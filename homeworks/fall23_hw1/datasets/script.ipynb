Akri continually detects nodes that have access to these devices and schedules workloads based on them.\\n\\nSimply put: you name it, Akri finds it, you use it.\\n\\n\\n----\\n## Why Akri\\nAt the edge, there are a variety of sensors, controllers, and MCU class devices that are producing data and performing actions. For Kubernetes to be a viable edge computing solution, these heterogeneous “leaf devices” need to be easily utilized by Kubernetes clusters. However, many of these leaf devices are too small to run Kubernetes themselves. Akri is an open source project that exposes these leaf devices as resources in a Kubernetes cluster. It leverages and extends the Kubernetes [device plugin framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/), which was created with the cloud in mind and focuses on advertising static resources such as GPUs and other system hardware. Akri took this framework and applied it to the edge, where there is a diverse set of leaf devices with unique communication protocols and intermittent availability.\\n\\nAkri is made for the edge, **handling the dynamic appearance and disappearance of leaf devices**. Akri provides an abstraction layer similar to [CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni), but instead of abstracting the underlying network details, it is removing the work of finding, utilizing, and monitoring the availability of the leaf device. An operator simply has to apply a Akri Configuration to a cluster, specifying the Discovery Handler (say ONVIF) that should be used to discover the devices and the Pod that should be deployed upon discovery (say a video frame server). Then, Akri does the rest. An operator can also allow multiple nodes to utilize a leaf device, thereby **providing high availability** in the case where a node goes offline. Furthermore, Akri will automatically create a Kubernetes service for each type of leaf device (or Akri Configuration), removing the need for an application to track the state of pods or nodes.\\n\\nMost importantly, Akri **was built to be extensible**. Akri currently supports ONVIF, udev, and OPC UA Discovery Handlers, but more can be easily added by community members like you. The more protocols Akri can support, the wider an array of leaf devices Akri can discover. We are excited to work with you to build a more connected edge.\\n\\n## How Akri Works\\nAkri’s architecture is made up of five key components: two custom resources, Discovery Handlers, an Agent (device plugin implementation), and a custom Controller. The first custom resource, the Akri Configuration, is where **you name it**. This tells Akri what kind of device it should look for. At this point, **Akri finds it**! Akri\\'s Discovery Handlers look for the device and inform the Agent of discovered devices. The Agent then creates Akri\\'s second custom resource, the Akri Instance, to track the availability and usage of the device. Having found your device, the Akri Controller helps **you use it**. It sees each Akri Instance (which represents a leaf device) and deploys a (\"broker\") Pod that knows how to connect to the resource and utilize it.\\n\\n<img src=\"https://github.com/project-akri/akri-docs/blob/main/media/akri-architecture.svg\" alt=\"Akri Architecture\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10px padding-top: 10px;\\nmargin-right: auto; display: block; margin-left: auto;\"/>\\n\\n## Quick Start with a Demo\\nTry the [end to end demo](https://docs.akri.sh/demos/usb-camera-demo) of Akri to see Akri discover mock video cameras and a streaming app display the footage from those cameras. It includes instructions on K8s cluster setup. If you would like to perform the demo on a cluster of Raspberry Pi 4\\'s, see the [Raspberry Pi 4 demo](https://docs.akri.sh/demos/usb-camera-demo-rpi4).\\n\\n## Documentation\\nSee Akri\\'s [documentation site](https://docs.akri.sh/), which includes:\\n- [User guide for deploying Akri using Helm](https://docs.akri.sh/user-guide/getting-started)\\n- [Akri architecture](https://docs.akri.sh/architecture/architecture-overview)\\n- [How to build Akri](https://docs.akri.sh/development/building)\\n- [How to extend Akri for protocols that haven\\'t been supported yet](https://docs.akri.sh/development/handler-development).\\n- [How to create a broker to leverage discovered devices](https://docs.akri.sh/development/broker-development).\\nTo contribute to Akri\\'s documentation, visit Akri\\'s [docs repository](https://github.com/project-akri/akri-docs).\\n\\n## Roadmap\\nAkri is built to be extensible. We currently have ONVIF, udev, OPC UA Discovery Handlers, but as a community, we hope to continuously support more protocols. We have created a [Discovery Handler implementation roadmap](https://docs.akri.sh/community/roadmap#implement-additional-discovery-handlers) in order to prioritize development of Discovery Handlers. If there is a protocol you feel we should prioritize, please [create an issue](https://github.com/project-akri/akri/issues/new/choose), or better yet, contribute the implementation!\\n\\nTo see what else is in store for Akri, reference our [roadmap](https://docs.akri.sh/community/roadmap).\\n\\n## Community, Contributing, and Support\\nYou can reach the Akri community via the [#akri](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/akri) channel in [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com) or join our [community calls](https://hackmd.io/@akri/S1GKJidJd) on the first Tuesday of the month at 9:00 AM PT.\\n\\nAkri welcomes contributions, whether by [creating new issues](https://github.com/project-akri/akri/issues/new/choose) or pull requests.

For historical reasons note that the [`cdk8s`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cdk8s) package is maintained in the `cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core` repository.\\n- [cdk8s-cli](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-cli) - Command-Line interface.\\n- [cdk8s-plus](https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-plus) - High-Level constructs for Kubernetes core.\\n\\nThe current repository acts as an umbrella repository for cross module concerns, as well as the deployment of [`cdk8s.io`](https://cdk8s.io)\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n**cdk8s** apps are programs written in one of the supported programming\\nlanguages. They are structured as a tree of\\n[constructs](https://github.com/aws/constructs).\\n\\nThe root of the tree is an `App` construct. Within an app, users define any\\nnumber of charts (classes that extend the `Chart` class). Each chart is\\nsynthesized into a separate Kubernetes manifest file. Charts are, in turn,\\ncomposed of any number of constructs, and eventually from resources, which\\nrepresent any Kubernetes resource, such as `Pod`, `Service`, `Deployment`,\\n`ReplicaSet`, etc.\\n\\ncdk8s apps only ***define*** Kubernetes applications, they don't actually apply\\nthem to the cluster. When an app is executed, it *synthesizes* all the charts\\ndefined within the app into the `dist` directory, and then those charts can be\\napplied to any Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl apply -f dist/chart.k8s.yaml` or a GitOps tool like [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/).\\n\\n> **cdk8s** is based on the design concepts and technologies behind the [AWS\\nCloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk), and can interoperate with\\nAWS CDK constructs to define cloud-native applications that include both\\nKubernetes resources and other CDK constructs as first class citizens.\\n\\nRead [our blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-cdk-for-kubernetes/) or [watch our CNCF webinar](https://www.cncf.io/webinars/end-yaml-engineering-with-cdk8s/) to learn more and see a live demo of cdk8s in action.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nSee the [Getting Started](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/getting-started) guide in\\n[cdk8s Documentation](https://cdk8s.io/docs/).\\n\\n## Help & Feedback\\n\\nInteracting with the community and the development team is a great way to\\ncontribute to the project.

By keeping an inventory of deployed resources, kpt enables resource pruning,\\n  aggregated status and observability, and an improved preview experience.\\n\\n- **Function SDKs**: Any general-purpose or domain-specific language can be used to create functions to transform and/or validate\\n  the YAML KRM input/output format, but we provide SDKs to simplify the function authoring process, in \\n  [Go](https://kpt.dev/book/05-developing-functions/02-developing-in-Go), \\n  [Typescript](https://kpt.dev/book/05-developing-functions/03-developing-in-Typescript), and \\n  [Starlark](https://kpt.dev/book/05-developing-functions/04-developing-in-Starlark), a Python-like embedded language.\\n\\n- **Function catalog**: A [catalog](https://catalog.kpt.dev/) of off-the-shelf, tested functions. kpt makes configuration\\n  easy to create and transform, via reusable functions. Because they are expected to be used for in-place transformation,\\n  the functions need to be idempotent.\\n\\n- **Package orchestrator**: \\n  The [package orchestrator](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/blob/main/docs/design-docs/07-package-orchestration.md)\\n  enables the magic behind the unique WYSIWYG experience. It provides a control plane for creating,\\n  modifying, updating, and deleting packages, and evaluating functions on package data. This enables operations on packaged resources\\n  similar to operations directly on the live state through the Kubernetes API.\\n\\n- **Config Sync**: While the package orchestrator\\n  can be used with any GitOps tool, [Config Sync](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt-config-sync) provides a reference GitOps implementation to complete the WYSIWYG management\\n  experience and enable end-to-end development of new features, such as \\n  [OCI-based packages](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/issues/2300). Config Sync is also helping to drive improvements\\n  in upstream Kubernetes. For instance, Config Sync is built on top of [git-sync](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync) and\\n  leverages [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io) to automatically render manifests on the fly when needed. It uses the same apply\\n  logic as the kpt CLI.\\n\\n- **Backstage UI plugin**: We\\'ve created a proof-of-concept UI in the form of a [Backstage UI plugin](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt-backstage-plugins) to demonstrate the WYSIWYG experience that\\'s possible on top of the\\n  package orchestrator. More scenarios can be supported by implementing form-based editors for additional Kubernetes resource types.\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\nYou can read about the big upcoming features in the \\n[roadmap doc](/docs/ROADMAP.md).\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nIf you are interested in contributing please start with \\n[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\n## Contact\\n\\nWe would love to keep in touch:\\n\\n1. Join our [Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/channels/kpt). You\\'ll\\n   need to join [Kubernetes on Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/) first.\\n1.

It also supports **MQTT** which enables edge devices to access through edge nodes.\\n\\nWith KubeEdge it is easy to get and deploy existing complicated machine learning, image recognition, event processing and other high level applications to the Edge.\\nWith business logic running at the Edge, much larger volumes of data can be secured & processed locally where the data is produced.\\nWith data processed at the Edge, the responsiveness is increased dramatically and data privacy is protected.\\n\\nKubeEdge is an incubation-level hosted project by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF). KubeEdge incubation [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/09/16/toc-approves-kubeedge-as-incubating-project/) by CNCF.\\n\\n**Note**:\\n\\nThe versions before *1.8* have not been supported, please try upgrade.\\n\\n## Advantages\\n\\n- **Kubernetes-native support**: Managing edge applications and edge devices in the cloud with fully compatible Kubernetes APIs.\\n- **Cloud-Edge Reliable Collaboration**: Ensure reliable messages delivery without loss over unstable cloud-edge network.\\n- **Edge Autonomy**: Ensure edge nodes run autonomously and the applications in edge run normally, when the cloud-edge network is unstable or edge is offline and restarted.\\n- **Edge Devices Management**: Managing edge devices through Kubernetes native APIs implemented by CRD.\\n- **Extremely Lightweight Edge Agent**: Extremely lightweight Edge Agent(EdgeCore) to run on resource constrained edge.\\n\\n\\n## How It Works\\n\\nKubeEdge consists of cloud part and edge part.\\n\\n### Architecture\\n\\n<div  align=\"center\">\\n<img src=\"./docs/images/kubeedge_arch.png\" width = \"85%\" align=\"center\">\\n</div>\\n\\n### In the Cloud\\n- [CloudHub](https://kubeedge.io/en/docs/architecture/cloud/cloudhub): a web socket server responsible for watching changes at the cloud side, caching and sending messages to EdgeHub.\\n- [EdgeController](https://kubeedge.io/en/docs/architecture/cloud/edge_controller): an extended kubernetes controller which manages edge nodes and pods metadata so that the data can be targeted to a specific edge node.\\n- [DeviceController](https://kubeedge.io/en/docs/architecture/cloud/device_controller): an extended kubernetes controller which manages devices so that the device metadata/status data can be synced between edge and cloud.\\n\\n\\n### On the Edge\\n- [EdgeHub](https://kubeedge.io/en/docs/architecture/edge/edgehub): a web socket client responsible for interacting with Cloud Service for the edge computing (like Edge Controller as in the KubeEdge Architecture). This includes syncing cloud-side resource updates to the edge, and reporting edge-side host and device status changes to the cloud.\\n- [Edged](https://kubeedge.io/en/docs/architecture/edge/edged): an agent that runs on edge nodes and manages containerized applications.\\n- [EventBus](https://kubeedge.io/en/docs/architecture/edge/eventbus): a MQTT client to interact with MQTT servers (mosquitto), offering publish and subscribe capabilities to other components.\\n- [ServiceBus](https://kubeedge.io/en/docs/architecture/edge/servicebus): an HTTP client to interact with HTTP servers (REST), offering HTTP client capabilities to components of cloud to reach HTTP servers running at edge.\\n- [DeviceTwin](https://kubeedge.io/en/docs/architecture/edge/devicetwin): responsible for storing device status and syncing device status to the cloud. It also provides query interfaces for applications.\\n- [MetaManager](https://kubeedge.io/en/docs/architecture/edge/metamanager): the message processor between edged and edgehub.

OpenYurt preserves intact Kubernetes API compatibility,\\nis vendor agnostic, and more importantly, is **SIMPLE** to use.\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nOpenYurt follows a classic cloud-edge architecture design.\\nIt uses a centralized Kubernetes control plane residing in the cloud site to\\nmanage multiple edge nodes residing in the edge sites. Each edge node has moderate compute resources available in order to\\nrun edge applications plus the required OpenYurt components. The edge nodes in a cluster can span\\nmultiple physical regions, which are referred to as `Pools` in OpenYurt.\\n\\n<div align=\"left\">\\n  <img src=\"docs/img/arch.png\" width=70% title=\"OpenYurt architecture\">\\n</div>\\n\\nThe above figure demonstrates the core OpenYurt architecture. The major components consist of:\\n\\n- **[YurtHub](https://openyurt.io/docs/next/core-concepts/yurthub)**: YurtHub runs on worker nodes as static pod and serves as a node sidecar to handle requests that comes from components (like Kubelet, Kubeproxy, etc.) on worker nodes to kube-apiserver.\\n- **[Yurt-Manager](https://github.com/openyurtio/openyurt/tree/master/cmd/yurt-manager)**: include all controllers and webhooks for edge.\\n- **[Raven-Agent](https://openyurt.io/docs/next/core-concepts/raven)**: It is focused on edge-edge and edge-cloud communication in OpenYurt, and provides layer 3 network connectivity among pods in different physical regions, as there are in one vanilla Kubernetes cluster.\\n- **Yurt-Coordinator**: One instance of Yurt-Coordinator is deployed in every edge NodePool, and in conjunction with YurtHub to provide heartbeat delegation, cloud-edge traffic multiplexing abilities, etc.\\n\\nIn addition, OpenYurt also includes auxiliary controllers for integration and customization purposes.\\n\\n- **[Node resource manager](https://openyurt.io/docs/next/core-concepts/node-resource-manager)**: It manages additional edge node resources such as LVM, QuotaPath and Persistent Memory.\\n  Please refer to [node-resource-manager](https://github.com/openyurtio/node-resource-manager) repo for more details.\\n- **[Integrating EdgeX Foundry platform and uses Kubernetes CRD to manage edge devices!](https://openyurt.io/docs/next/core-concepts/yurt-device-controller/)**\\n<table>\\n<tr style=\"border:none\">\\n<td style=\"width:80%;border:none\">OpenYurt introduces <a href=\"https://github.com/openyurtio/yurt-edgex-manager\">Yurt-edgex-manager</a> to manage the lifecycle of the EdgeX Foundry software suite, and <a href=\"https://github.com/openyurtio/yurt-device-controller\">Yurt-device-controller</a> to manage edge devices hosted by EdgeX Foundry via Kubernetes custom resources.

Welcome to checkout and try [edgeadm](https://github.com/superedge/edgeadm/releases/tag/v0.9.0)\\n\\n----\\n\\n## What is SuperEdge?\\n\\nSuperEdge is an open source **container management system for edge computing** to manage compute resources and container applications in multiple edge regions. These resources and applications, in the current approach, are managed as one single **Kubernetes** cluster. A native Kubernetes cluster can be easily converted to a SuperEdge cluster.\\n\\nSuperEdge has the following characteristics:\\n\\n* **Kubernetes-native**: SuperEdge extends the powerful container orchestration and scheduling capabilities of Kubernetes to the edge. It makes nonintrusive enhancements to Kubernetes and is fully compatible with all Kubernetes APIs and resources. Kubernetes users can leverage SuperEdge easily for edge environments with minimal learning.\\n\\n* **Edge autonomy**: Now SuperEdge provides L4/L5 edge autonomy. \\n  \\n  L3: When the network connection between the edge and the cloud is unstable, or the edge node is offline, the node can still work independently. But at this time, edge node can\\'t do anything associated with writing operation, such as create/delete/update.\\n  \\n  L4/L5: Now SuperEdge has released v0.9.0 which support Kins [[English](docs/components/kins.md), [中文](docs/components/kins_CN.md)] Feature. Kins will provision a lightweight K3s cluster based on SuperEdge, which can be operated totally offline. L4 level will leverage the single master edge K3s cluster, and L5 level will provision 3 master edge K3s cluster.\\n\\n* **Distributed node health monitoring**: SuperEdge provides edge-side health monitoring capabilities. SuperEdge can continue to monitor the processes on the edge side and collect health information for faster and more accurate problem discovery and reporting. In addition, its distributed design can provide multi-region monitoring and management.\\n\\n* **Built-in edge orchestration capability**: SuperEdge supports automatic deployment of multi-regional microservices.\\n  Edge-side services are closed-looped, and it effectively reduces the operational overhead and improves the fault\\n  tolerance and availability of the system.\\n\\n* **Network tunneling**: SuperEdge ensures that Kubernetes nodes can operate under different network situations. It\\n  supports network tunnelling using TCP, HTTP, HTTPS and SSH.\\n\\nSuperEdge was initiated by the following companies: Tencent, Intel, VMware, Huya, Cambricon, Captialonline and Meituan.\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\n<div align=\"center\">\\n  <img src=\"docs/img/superedge_arch.png\" width=80% title=\"SuperEdge Architecture\">\\n</div>\\n\\n### Cloud components:\\n\\n* [**tunnel-cloud**](docs/components/tunnel_CN.md): Maintains a persistent network connection to `tunnel-edge` services. Supports TCP/HTTP/HTTPS network proxies.\\n* [**application-grid controller**](docs/components/serviceGroup.md): A Kubernetes CRD controller as part of ServiceGroup. It manages DeploymentGrids, StatefulSetGrids and ServiceGrids CRDs and control applications and network traffic on edge worker nodes.\\n* [**edge-health admission**](docs/components/edge-health.md): Assists Kubernetes controllers by providing real-time health check status from `edge-health` services distributed on all edge worker nodes.\\n* [**site-manager**](docs/components/kins_CN.md): A Kubernetes CRD controller which will manipulate `NodeUnit`and `NodeGroup`. And this controller is also responsible for **Kins** feature.\\n\\n### Edge components:\\n\\n* [**lite-apiserver**](docs/components/lite-apiserver.md): Lightweight kube-apiserver for edge autonomy.

The meeting details can be found [here][7].\\n\\nCommunity Resources:\\n\\n-   [Community Slack](https://eqix-metal-community.slack.com/)\\n-   [CNCF #tinkerbell](https://app.slack.com/client/T08PSQ7BQ/C01SRB41GMT)\\n-   [YouTube Channel (demos, meeting recordings, virtual meetups)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTzWInTQPvzH21KHS8jrq7A/featured)\\n\\n## What's Powering Tinkerbell?\\n\\nThe Tinkerbell stack consists of several microservices, and a gRPC API:\\n\\n### Tink\\n\\n[Tink][1] is the short-hand name for the tink-server and tink-worker.\\n`tink-worker` and `tink-server` communicate over gRPC, and are responsible for processing workflows.\\nThe CLI is the user-interactive piece for creating workflows and their building blocks, templates and hardware data.\\n\\n### Boots\\n\\n[Boots][2] is Tinkerbell's DHCP server.\\nIt handles DHCP requests, hands out IPs, and serves up iPXE.\\nIt uses the Tinkerbell client to pull and push hardware data.\\nIt only responds to a predefined set of MAC addresses so it can be deployed in an existing network without interfering with existing DHCP infrastructure.\\n\\n### Hegel\\n\\n[Hegel][3] is the metadata service used by Tinkerbell and OSIE.\\nIt collects data from both and transforms it into a JSON format to be consumed as metadata.\\n\\n### OSIE\\n\\n[OSIE][4] is Tinkerbell's default an in-memory installation environment for bare metal.\\nIt installs operating systems and handles deprovisioning.\\n\\n### Hook\\n\\n[Hook][5] is the newly introduced alternative to OSIE.\\nIt's the next iteration of the in-memory installation environment to handle operating system installation and deprovisioning.\\n\\n### PBnJ\\n\\n[PBnJ][6] is an optional microservice that can communicate with baseboard management controllers (BMCs) to control power and boot settings.\\n\\n## Building\\n\\nUse `make help`.\\nThe most interesting targets are `make all` (or just `make`) and `make images`.\\n`make all` builds all the binaries for your host OS and CPU to enable running directly.\\n`make images` will build all the binaries for Linux/x86_64 and build docker images with them.\\n\\n## Configuring OpenTelemetry\\n\\nRather than adding a bunch of command line options or a config file, OpenTelemetry\\nis configured via environment variables. The most relevant ones are below, for others\\nsee https://github.com/equinix-labs/otel-init-go\\n\\nCurrently this is just for tracing, metrics needs to be discussed with the community.\\n\\n| Env Variable                  | Required | Default   |\\n| ----------------------------- | -------- | --------- |\\n| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | n        | localhost |\\n| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE` | n        | false     |\\n| `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL`              | n        | info      |\\n\\nTo work with a local [opentelemetry-collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector),\\ntry the following.

Harbor extends the open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and management. Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency. Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.\\n\\nHarbor is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of cloud native technologies, consider joining the CNCF. For details about whose involved and how Harbor plays a role, read the CNCF\\n[announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/07/31/cncf-to-host-harbor-in-the-sandbox/).\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n* **Cloud native registry**: With support for both container images and [Helm](https://helm.sh) charts, Harbor serves as registry for cloud native environments like container runtimes and orchestration platforms.\\n* **Role based access control**: Users access different repositories through \\'projects\\' and a user can have different permission for images or Helm charts under a project.\\n* **Policy based replication**: Images and charts can be replicated (synchronized) between multiple registry instances based on policies with using filters (repository, tag and label). Harbor automatically retries a replication if it encounters any errors. This can be used to assist loadbalancing, achieve high availability, and facilitate multi-datacenter deployments in hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios.\\n* **Vulnerability Scanning**: Harbor scans images regularly for vulnerabilities and has policy checks to prevent vulnerable images from being deployed.\\n* **LDAP/AD support**: Harbor integrates with existing enterprise LDAP/AD for user authentication and management, and supports importing LDAP groups into Harbor that can then be given permissions to specific projects.  \\n* **OIDC support**: Harbor leverages OpenID Connect (OIDC) to verify the identity of users authenticated by an external authorization server or identity provider. Single sign-on can be enabled to log into the Harbor portal.  \\n* **Image deletion & garbage collection**: System admin can run garbage collection jobs so that images(dangling manifests and unreferenced blobs) can be deleted and their space can be freed up periodically.\\n* **Notary**: Support signing container images using Docker Content Trust (leveraging Notary) for guaranteeing authenticity and provenance.  In addition, policies that prevent unsigned images from being deployed can also be activated.\\n* **Graphical user portal**: User can easily browse, search repositories and manage projects.\\n* **Auditing**: All the operations to the repositories are tracked through logs.\\n* **RESTful API**: RESTful APIs are provided to facilitate administrative operations, and are easy to use for integration with external systems. An embedded Swagger UI is available for exploring and testing the API.\\n* **Easy deployment**: Harbor can be deployed via Docker compose as well Helm Chart, and a Harbor Operator was added recently as well.\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nFor learning the architecture design of Harbor, check the document [Architecture Overview of Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/wiki/Architecture-Overview-of-Harbor).\\n\\n## API\\n\\n* Harbor RESTful API: The APIs for most administrative operations of Harbor and can be used to perform integrations with Harbor programmatically.\\n  * Part 1: [New or changed APIs](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goharbor/harbor/main/api/v2.0/swagger.yaml)\\n\\n## Install & Run\\n\\n**System requirements:**\\n\\n**On a Linux host:** docker 17.06.0-ce+ and docker-compose 1.18.0+ .\\n\\nDownload binaries of **[Harbor release ](https://github.com/vmware/harbor/releases)** and follow **[Installation & Configuration Guide](https://goharbor.io/docs/latest/install-config/)** to install Harbor.\\n\\nIf you want to deploy Harbor on Kubernetes, please use the **[Harbor chart](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor-helm)**.\\n\\nRefer to the **[documentation](https://goharbor.io/docs/)** for more details on how to use Harbor.\\n\\n## OCI Distribution Conformance Tests\\n\\nCheck the OCI distribution conformance tests [report](https://storage.googleapis.com/harbor-conformance-test/report.html) of Harbor.\\n\\n## Compatibility\\n\\nThe [compatibility list](https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/install-config/harbor-compatibility-list/) document provides compatibility information for the Harbor components.\\n\\n* [Replication adapters](https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/install-config/harbor-compatibility-list/#replication-adapters)\\n* [OIDC adapters](https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/install-config/harbor-compatibility-list/#oidc-adapters)\\n* [Scanner adapters](https://goharbor.io/docs/edge/install-config/harbor-compatibility-list/#scanner-adapters)\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n* **Twitter:** [@project_harbor](https://twitter.com/project_harbor)  \\n* **User Group:** Join Harbor user email group: [harbor-users@lists.cncf.io](https://lists.cncf.io/g/harbor-users) to get update of Harbor\\'s news, features, releases, or to provide suggestion and feedback.  \\n* **Developer Group:** Join Harbor developer group: [harbor-dev@lists.cncf.io](https://lists.cncf.io/g/harbor-dev) for discussion on Harbor development and contribution.\\n* **Slack:** Join Harbor\\'s community for discussion and ask questions: [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://slack.cncf.io/), channel: [#harbor](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/harbor/) and [#harbor-dev](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/harbor-dev/)\\n\\n## Demos\\n\\n* **[Live Demo](https://demo.goharbor.io)** - A demo environment with the latest Harbor stable build installed.

Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/7355/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/7355)\\n\\nThe Konveyor Operator fully manages the deployment and life cycle of Konveyor on Kubernetes and OpenShift.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\nPlease ensure the following requirements are met prior installation.\\n\\n* [__k8s v1.22+__](https://kubernetes.io/) or [__OpenShift 4.9+__](https://www.openshift.com/)\\n* [__Persistent Storage__](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)\\n* [__Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) support__](https://olm.operatorframework.io/)\\n* [__Ingress support__](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)\\n* [__Network policy support__](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)\\n\\n### Installing OLM support\\n\\nWe strongly suggest OLM support for Tackle deployments, in some production kubernetes clusters OLM might already be present, if not, see the following examples in how to add OLM support to minikube or standard kubernetes clusters below:\\n\\n#### Minikube:\\n\\n`$ minikube addons enable olm`\\n\\n`$ minikube addons enable ingress`\\n\\n#### Kubernetes:\\n\\n`$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/master/deploy/upstream/quickstart/crds.yaml`\\n\\n`$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/master/deploy/upstream/quickstart/olm.yaml`\\n\\nFor details and official instructions in how to add OLM support to kubernetes and customize your installation see [here](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/install/install.md)\\n\\n**Note:** Please wait a few minutes for OLM support to become available if this is a new deployment.\\n\\n#### Kubernetes Network Policies\\n\\nTackle can provide namespace network isolation if a supported CNI, such as [Calico](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/network_policy/#further-reading), is installed.\\n\\n`$ minikube start --network-plugin=cni --cni=calico`\\n\\n## Konveyor Operator Installation on k8s\\n\\n### Installing _released versions_\\n\\nReleased (or public betas) of Konveyor are installable on Kubernetes via [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/operator/konveyor-operator).\\n\\n### Installing _latest_\\n\\nDeploy Konveyor using manifest:\\n\\n`$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konveyor/tackle2-operator/main/tackle-k8s.yaml`\\n\\nThis step will create the konveyor-tackle namespace, catalogsource and other OLM related objects.\\n\\n### Installing _beta_ (or special branches)\\n\\nIf you need to deploy a beta release (or special branch) please replace the *main* branch in URL with the desired beta branch (i.e v2.0.0-beta.0):\\n\\n`$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konveyor/tackle2-operator/v2.0.0-beta.0/tackle-k8s.yaml`\\n\\n**Note:** Upgrades between beta releases are **not guaranteed** , once installed, we strongly suggest to edit your subscription and switch to Manual upgrade mode for beta releases: `$ kubectl edit subscription` -> installPlanApproval: Manual\\n\\n### Creating a _Tackle_ CR\\n\\n**Note:** Tackle **requires** a storage class that supports RWX volumes, please review storage requirements **prior** creating the Tackle CR in case you need to adjust settings.\\n\\n```\\n$ cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -\\nkind: Tackle\\napiVersion: tackle.konveyor.io/v1alpha1\\nmetadata:\\n  name: tackle\\n  namespace: <your-tackle-namespace>\\nspec:\\nEOF\\n```\\n\\nOnce the CR is created, the operator will deploy the hub, UI and configure the rest of required components.\\n\\n### Verify _Tackle_ Deployment\\n\\nDepending on your hardware it should take around 1-3 minutes to deploy Tackle, below is a sample output of a successful deployment\\n\\n```\\n$ kubectl get pods\\nNAME                                                           READY   STATUS      RESTARTS

Clients write their authentication logic once to talk to dex, then dex handles the protocols for a given backend.\\n\\n## ID Tokens\\n\\nID Tokens are an OAuth2 extension introduced by OpenID Connect and dex\\'s primary feature. ID Tokens are [JSON Web Tokens][jwt-io] (JWTs) signed by dex and returned as part of the OAuth2 response that attest to the end user\\'s identity. An example JWT might look like:\\n\\n```\\neyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjlkNDQ3NDFmNzczYjkzOGNmNjVkZDMyNjY4NWI4NjE4MGMzMjRkOTkifQ.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi8vMTI3LjAuMC4xOjU1NTYvZGV4Iiwic3ViIjoiQ2djeU16UXlOelE1RWdabmFYUm9kV0kiLCJhdWQiOiJleGFtcGxlLWFwcCIsImV4cCI6MTQ5Mjg4MjA0MiwiaWF0IjoxNDkyNzk1NjQyLCJhdF9oYXNoIjoiYmk5NmdPWFpTaHZsV1l0YWw5RXFpdyIsImVtYWlsIjoiZXJpYy5jaGlhbmdAY29yZW9zLmNvbSIsImVtYWlsX3ZlcmlmaWVkIjp0cnVlLCJncm91cHMiOlsiYWRtaW5zIiwiZGV2ZWxvcGVycyJdLCJuYW1lIjoiRXJpYyBDaGlhbmcifQ.OhROPq_0eP-zsQRjg87KZ4wGkjiQGnTi5QuG877AdJDb3R2ZCOk2Vkf5SdP8cPyb3VMqL32G4hLDayniiv8f1_ZXAde0sKrayfQ10XAXFgZl_P1yilkLdknxn6nbhDRVllpWcB12ki9vmAxklAr0B1C4kr5nI3-BZLrFcUR5sQbxwJj4oW1OuG6jJCNGHXGNTBTNEaM28eD-9nhfBeuBTzzO7BKwPsojjj4C9ogU4JQhGvm_l4yfVi0boSx8c0FX3JsiB0yLa1ZdJVWVl9m90XmbWRSD85pNDQHcWZP9hR6CMgbvGkZsgjG32qeRwUL_eNkNowSBNWLrGNPoON1gMg\\n```\\n\\nID Tokens contains standard claims assert which client app logged the user in, when the token expires, and the identity of the user.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"iss\": \"http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex\",\\n  \"sub\": \"CgcyMzQyNzQ5EgZnaXRodWI\",\\n  \"aud\": \"example-app\",\\n  \"exp\": 1492882042,\\n  \"iat\": 1492795642,\\n  \"at_hash\": \"bi96gOXZShvlWYtal9Eqiw\",\\n  \"email\": \"jane.doe@coreos.com\",\\n  \"email_verified\": true,\\n  \"groups\": [\\n    \"admins\",\\n    \"developers\"\\n  ],\\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBecause these tokens are signed by dex and [contain standard-based claims][standard-claims] other services can consume them as service-to-service credentials. Systems that can already consume OpenID Connect ID Tokens issued by dex include:\\n\\n* [Kubernetes][kubernetes]\\n* [AWS STS][aws-sts]\\n\\nFor details on how to request or validate an ID Token, see [_\"Writing apps that use dex\"_][using-dex].\\n\\n## Kubernetes and Dex\\n\\nDex runs natively on top of any Kubernetes cluster using Custom Resource Definitions and can drive API server authentication through the OpenID Connect plugin. Clients, such as the [`kubernetes-dashboard`](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) and `kubectl`, can act on behalf of users who can login to the cluster through any identity provider dex supports.\\n\\n* More docs for running dex as a Kubernetes authenticator can be found [here](https://dexidp.io/docs/kubernetes/).\\n* You can find more about companies and projects, which uses dex, [here](./ADOPTERS.md).\\n\\n## Connectors\\n\\nWhen a user logs in through dex, the user\\'s identity is usually stored in another user-management system: a LDAP directory, a GitHub org, etc. Dex acts as a shim between a client app and the upstream identity provider. The client only needs to understand OpenID Connect to query dex, while dex implements an array of protocols for querying other user-management systems.\\n\\n![](docs/img/dex-flow.png)\\n\\nA \"connector\" is a strategy used by dex for authenticating a user against another identity provider. Dex implements connectors that target specific platforms such as GitHub, LinkedIn, and Microsoft as well as established protocols like LDAP and SAML.\\n\\nDepending on the connectors limitations in protocols can prevent dex from issuing [refresh tokens][scopes] or returning [group membership][scopes] claims. For example, because SAML doesn\\'t provide a non-interactive way to refresh assertions, if a user logs in through the SAML connector dex won\\'t issue a refresh token to its client. Refresh token support is required for clients that require offline access, such as `kubectl`.\\n\\nDex implements the following connectors:\\n\\n| Name | supports refresh tokens | supports groups claim | supports preferred_username claim | status | notes |\\n| ---- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |\\n| [LDAP](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/ldap/) | yes | yes | yes | stable | |\\n| [GitHub](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/github/) | yes | yes | yes | stable | |\\n| [SAML 2.0](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/saml/) | no | yes | no | stable | WARNING: Unmaintained and likely vulnerable to auth bypasses ([#1884](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/discussions/1884)) |\\n| [GitLab](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/gitlab/) | yes | yes | yes | beta | |\\n| [OpenID Connect](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/oidc/) | yes | yes | yes | beta | Includes Salesforce, Azure, etc. |\\n| [OAuth 2.0](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/oauth/) | no | yes | yes | alpha | |\\n| [Google](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/google/) | yes | yes | yes | alpha | |\\n| [LinkedIn](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/linkedin/) | yes | no | no | beta | |\\n| [Microsoft](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/microsoft/) | yes | yes | no | beta | |\\n| [AuthProxy](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/authproxy/) | no | yes | no | alpha | Authentication proxies such as Apache2 mod_auth, etc. |\\n| [Bitbucket Cloud](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/bitbucketcloud/) | yes | yes | no | alpha | |\\n| [OpenShift](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/openshift/) | no | yes | no | alpha | |\\n| [Atlassian Crowd](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/atlassiancrowd/) | yes | yes | yes * | beta | preferred_username claim must be configured through config |\\n| [Gitea](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/gitea/) | yes | no | yes | beta | |\\n| [OpenStack Keystone](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/keystone/) | yes | yes | no | alpha | |\\n\\nStable, beta, and alpha are defined as:\\n\\n* Stable: well tested, in active use, and will not change in backward incompatible ways.\\n* Beta: tested and unlikely to change in backward incompatible ways.\\n* Alpha: may be untested by core maintainers and is subject to change in backward incompatible ways.\\n\\nAll changes or deprecations of connector features will be announced in the [release notes][release-notes].\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\n* [Getting started](https://dexidp.io/docs/getting-started/)\\n* [Intro to OpenID Connect](https://dexidp.io/docs/openid-connect/)\\n* [Writing apps that use dex][using-dex]\\n* [What\\'s new in v2](https://dexidp.io/docs/v2/)\\n* [Custom scopes, claims, and client features](https://dexidp.io/docs/custom-scopes-claims-clients/)\\n* [Storage options](https://dexidp.io/docs/storage/)\\n* [gRPC API](https://dexidp.io/docs/api/)\\n* [Using Kubernetes with dex](https://dexidp.io/docs/kubernetes/)\\n* Client libraries\\n  * [Go][go-oidc]\\n\\n## Reporting a vulnerability\\n\\nPlease see our [security policy](.github/SECURITY.md) for details about reporting vulnerabilities.\\n\\n## Getting help\\n\\n- For feature requests and bugs, file an [issue](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/issues).\\n- For general discussion about both using and developing Dex:\\n    - join the [#dexidp](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/dexidp) on the CNCF Slack\\n    - open a new [discussion](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/discussions)\\n    - join the [dex-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dex-dev) mailing list\\n\\n[openid-connect]: https://openid.net/connect/\\n[standard-claims]: https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims\\n[scopes]: https://dexidp.io/docs/custom-scopes-claims-clients/#scopes\\n[using-dex]: https://dexidp.io/docs/using-dex/\\n[jwt-io]: https://jwt.io/\\n[kubernetes]: http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens\\n[aws-sts]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html\\n[go-oidc]: https://github.com/coreos/go-oidc\\n[issue-1065]: https://github.com/dexidp/dex/issues/1065\\n[release-notes]: https://github.com/dexidp/dex/releases\\n\\n## Development\\n\\nWhen all coding and testing is done, please run the test suite:\\n\\n```shell\\nmake testall\\n```\\n\\nFor the best developer experience, install [Nix](https://builtwithnix.org/) and [direnv](https://direnv.net/).\\n\\nAlternatively, install Go and Docker manually or using a package manager.

It is designed to detect and alert on abnormal behavior and potential security threats in real-time.\\n\\nAt its core, Falco is a kernel monitoring and detection agent that observes events, such as syscalls, based on custom rules. Falco can enhance these events by integrating metadata from the container runtime and Kubernetes. The collected events can be analyzed off-host in SIEM or data lake systems.\\n\\nFalco, originally created by [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com), is an incubating project under the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) used in production by various [organisations](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md).\\n\\nFor detailed technical information and insights into the cyber threats that Falco can detect, visit the official [Falco](https://falco.org/) website.\\n\\nFor comprehensive information on the latest updates and changes to the project, please refer to the [change log](CHANGELOG.md). Additionally, we have documented the [release process](RELEASE.md) for delivering new versions of Falco.\\n\\n## Falco Repo: Powering the Core of The Falco Project\\n\\nThis is the main Falco repository which contains the source code for building the Falco binary. By utilizing its [libraries](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs) and the [falco.yaml](falco.yaml) configuration file, this repository forms the foundation of Falco's functionality. The Falco repository is closely interconnected with the following *core* repositories:\\n\\n- [falcosecurity/libs](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs): Falco's libraries are key to its fundamental operations, making up the greater portion of the source code of the Falco binary and providing essential features such as kernel drivers.\\n- [falcosecurity/rules](https://github.com/falcosecurity/rules): Contains the official ruleset for Falco, providing pre-defined detection rules for various security threats and abnormal behaviors.\\n- [falcosecurity/plugins](https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/): Falco plugins facilitate integration with external services, expand Falco's capabilities beyond syscalls and container events, and are designed to evolve with specialized functionality in future releases.\\n- [falcosecurity/falcoctl](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcoctl): Command-line utility for managing and interacting with Falco.\\n\\nFor more information, visit the official hub of The Falco Project: [falcosecurity/evolution](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution). It provides valuable insights and information about the project's repositories.\\n\\n## Getting Started with Falco\\n\\nCarefully review and follow the [official guide and documentation](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/).\\n\\nConsiderations and guidance for Falco adopters:\\n\\n1. Understand dependencies: Assess the environment where you'll run Falco and consider kernel versions and architectures.\\n\\n2. Define threat detection objectives: Clearly identify the threats you want to detect and evaluate Falco's strengths and limitations.\\n\\n3. Consider performance and cost: Assess compute performance overhead and align with system administrators or SREs. Budget accordingly.\\n\\n4. Choose build and customization approach: Decide between the open source Falco build or creating a custom build pipeline. Customize the build and deployment process as necessary, including incorporating unique tests or approaches, to ensure a resilient deployment with fast deployment cycles.\\n\\n5. Integrate with output destinations: Integrate Falco with SIEM, data lake systems, or other preferred output destinations to establish a robust foundation for comprehensive data analysis and enable effective incident response workflows.\\n\\n\\n## How to Contribute\\n\\nPlease refer to the [contributing guide](https://github.com/falcosecurity/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [code of conduct](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information on how to contribute.\\n\\n\\n## Join the Community\\n\\nTo get involved with the Falco Project please visit the [community repository](https://github.com/falcosecurity/community) to find more information and ways to get involved.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about Falco or contributing, do not hesitate to file an issue or contact the Falco maintainers and community members for assistance.\\n\\nHow to reach out?\\n\\n - Join the [#falco](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/falco) channel on the [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io).\\n - Join the [Falco mailing list](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-falco-dev).\\n - File an [issue](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues) or make feature requests.\\n\\n## Commitment to Falco's Own Security\\n\\nFull reports of various security audits can be found [here](./audits/).\\n\\nIn addition, you can refer to the [falco security](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/security) and [libs security](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs/security) sections for detailed updates on security advisories and policies.\\n\\nTo report security vulnerabilities, please follow the community process outlined in the documentation found [here](https://github.com/falcosecurity/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\\n\\n## What's next for Falco?\\n\\nStay updated with Falco's evolving capabilities by exploring the [Falco Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/falcosecurity/projects/5), which provides insights into the features currently under development and planned for future releases.\\n\\n## License\\n\\nFalco is licensed to you under the [Apache 2.0](./COPYING) open source license.\\n\\n## Why is Falco in C++ rather than Go or {language}?\\n\\n1. The first lines of code at the base of Falco were written some time ago, where Go didn't yet have the same level of maturity and adoption as today.\\n2. The Falco execution model is sequential and mono-thread due to the statefulness requirements of the tool, and so most of the concurrency-related selling points of the Go runtime would not be leveraged at all.\\n3. The Falco code deals with very low-level programming in many places (e.g. some headers are shared with the eBPF probe and the Kernel module), and we all know that interfacing Go with C is possible but brings tons of complexity and tradeoffs to the table.\\n4. As a security tool meant to consume a crazy high throughput of events per second, Falco needs to squeeze performance in all hot paths at runtime and requires deep control on memory allocation, which the Go runtime can't provide (there's also garbage collection involved).\\n5. Although Go didn't suit the engineering requirements of the core of Falco, we still thought that it could be a good candidate for writing Falco extensions through the plugin system. This is the main reason we gave special attention and high priority to the development of the plugin-sdk-go.\\n6. Go is not a requirement for having statically-linked binaries. In fact, we provide fully-static Falco builds since few years. The only issue with those is that the plugin system can't be supported with the current dynamic library model we currently have.\\n7. The plugin system has been envisioned to support multiple languages, so on our end maintaining a C-compatible codebase is the best strategy to ensure maximum cross-language compatibility.\\n8. In general, plugins have GLIBC requirements/dependencies because they have low-level C bindings required for dynamic loading. A potential solution for the future could be to also support plugin to be statically-linked at compilation time and so released as bundled in the Falco binary. Although no work started yet in this direction, this would solve most issues you reported and would provide a totally-static binary too. Of course, this would not be compatible with dynamic loading anymore, but it may be a viable solution for our static-build flavor of Falco.\\n9. Memory safety is definitely a concern and we try our best to keep an high level of quality even though C++ is quite error prone. For instance, we try to use smart pointers whenever possible, we build the libraries with an address sanitizer in our CI, we run Falco through Valgrind before each release, and have ways to stress-test it to detect performance regressions or weird memory usage (e.g. https://github.com/falcosecurity/event-generator). On top of that, we also have third parties auditing the codebase by time to time. None of this make a perfect safety standpoint of course, but we try to maximize our odds. Go would definitely make our life easier from this perspective, however the tradeoffs never made it worth it so far due to the points above.\\n10. The C++ codebase of falcosecurity/libs, which is at the core of Falco, is quite large and complex. Porting all that code to another language would be a major effort requiring lots of development resource and with an high chance of failure and regression. As such, our approach so far has been to choose refactors and code polishing instead, up until we'll reach an optimal level of stability, quality, and modularity, on that portion of code. This would allow further developments to be smoother and more feasibile in the future.\\n\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n - [Governance](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md)\\n - [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\\n - [Maintainers Guidelines](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/blob/main/MAINTAINERS_GUIDELINES.md)\\n - [Maintainers List](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md)\\n - [Repositories Guidelines](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/blob/main/REPOSITORIES.md)\\n - [Repositories List](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/blob/main/README.md#repositories)\\n - [Adopters List](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md)\\n\",\n",

The below diagram describes the current provider architecture.\\n\\n![Hexa Provider Architecture](docs/hexa-provider-architecture.svg \"hexa provider architecture\")\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nThe Hexa project contains three applications\\n\\n- Policy Orchestrator with policy translations\\n- Demo Policy Administrator\\n- Demo web application\\n\\nTo get started with running these, clone or download the codebase from GitHub to your local machine:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd $HOME/workspace # or similar\\ngit clone git@github.com:hexa-org/policy-orchestrator.git\\n```\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nInstall the following dependencies.\\n\\n- [Go 1.20](https://go.dev)\\n- [Pack](https://buildpacks.io)\\n- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)\\n\\n> NOTE:\\n>\\n> These packages, along with a number of supporting software utilities, may be\\n> installed via `./bin/pkg.d/setup.sh`.\\n>\\n> Additionally, once that setup script has been run, the `pkg` bash CLI is made\\n> available and may be executed from anywhere within the repository. Try\\n> `pkg --help`, for example.\\n\\n### Task: Build the Hexa image\\n\\nBuild a Hexa image with `pack`. The newly created image will contain the policy\\nadministrator web application, policy orchestrator server, and demo application.\\n\\n```bash\\npack build hexa --builder heroku/buildpacks:20\\n```\\n\\n> NOTE:\\n>\\n> Assuming previous execution of the \"setup\" script above, this task may be run\\n> from anywhere in the repository as `pkg build`.\\n\\n### Task: Prepare the Database\\n\\nThe Hexa applications use PostgreSQL.

So...\\n\\n```bash\\nchmod 775 ./databases/docker_support/initdb.d/create-databases.sh\\nchmod 775 ./databases/docker_support/migrate-databases.sh\\nchmod 600 ./databases/docker_support/ca-cert.pem\\nchmod 600 ./databases/docker_support/client-cert.pem\\nchmod 600 ./databases/docker_support/client-key.pem\\n```\\n\\n> NOTE:\\n>\\n> Assuming previous execution of the \"setup\" script above, this task will be\\n> run as part of `pkg serve`, executable from anywhere in the repository.\\n\\n### Task: Run the Policy Orchestrator\\n\\n \\nRun all the applications with Docker Compose.\\n\\n> On Apple Silicon M1 (and M2) ARM\\n> ```bash\\n> DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 docker-compose up\\n> ```\\n\\n> Others\\n> ```bash\\n> docker-compose up\\n> ```\\n\\n> NOTE:\\n>\\n> Assuming previous execution of the \"setup\" script above, this task may be run\\n> from anywhere in the repository as `pkg build`.\\n\\n## Application Descriptions\\n\\nDocker runs the following applications:\\n\\n- **hexa-orchestrator**\\n\\n  Runs on [localhost:8885](http://localhost:8885/health). The main application\\n  that manages IDQL policy across various platforms and communicates with the\\n  various platform interfaces, converting IDQL policy to and from the respective\\n  platform types.\\n\\n- **hexa-admin**\\n\\n  Runs on [localhost:8884](http://localhost:8884/). An example application\\n  demonstrating the latest interactions with the policy orchestrator.\\n\\n- **hexa-demo**\\n\\n  Runs on [localhost:8886](http://localhost:8886/). A demo application used to\\n  highlight enforcing of both coarse and fine-grained policy. The application\\n  integrates with platform authentication/authorization proxies,\\n  [Google IAP](https://cloud.google.com/iap) for example, for coarse-grained\\n  access and the [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)\\n  for fine-grained policy access.\\n\\n- **OPA server**\\n\\n  Runs on [localhost:8887](http://localhost:8887/). The Open Policy Agent (OPA)\\n  server used to demonstrate fine-grained policy management. IDQL policy is\\n  represented as data and interpreted by the [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/)\\n  expression language.\\n\\n- **hexa-demo-config**\\n\\n  Runs on [localhost:8889](http://localhost:8889/health). The bundle HTTP\\n  server from which the OPA server can download the bundles of policy and data\\n  from. See [OPA bundles][opa-bundles] for more info.\\n\\n## Example Workflow\\n\\nFine-grained policy management with OPA.\\n\\nUsing the **hexa-admin** application available via `docker-compose`, upload an\\nOPA integration configuration file. The file describes the location of the IDQL\\npolicy. An example integration configuration file may be found in\\n[deployments/opa-server/example](deployments/opa-server/example).\\n\\nOnce configured, IDQL policy for the **hexa-demo** application can be modified\\non the [Applications](http://localhost:8884/applications) page. The\\n**hexa-admin** communicates the changes to the **hexa-orchestrator**, or\\n\"Policy Management Point (PMP)\", which then updates the **hexa-demo-config** bundle\\nserver, making the updated policy available to the OPA server.\\n\\nOPA, the \"Policy Decision Point (PDP)\", periodically reads config from the\\n**hexa-demo-config** bundle server and allows or denies access requests based on\\nthe IDQL policy. Decision enforcement is handled within the **hexa-demo**\\napplication or \"Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)\".\\n\\nThe Hexa Demo architecture may be visualized as follows:\\n\\n![Hexa Demo Architecture](docs/hexa-demo-architecture.svg \"hexa demo architecture\")\\n\\n## Getting involved\\n\\nTake a look at our [product backlog](https://github.com/orgs/hexa-org/projects/1)\\nwhere we maintain a fresh supply of good first issues.

It does so by verifying that each task in the chain is carried out as planned, by authorized personnel only, and that the product is not tampered with in transit.\\n\\nin-toto requires a **project owner** to create a **layout**. A layout lists the sequence of **steps** of the software supply chain, and the **functionaries** authorized to perform these steps.\\nWhen a functionary performs a step in-toto gathers information about the used command and the related files and stores it in a **link** metadata file. As a consequence link files provide the required evidence to establish a continuous chain that can be validated against the steps defined in the layout.\\n\\nThe layout, signed by the project owners, together with the links, signed by the designated functionaries, are released as part of the final product, and can be validated manually or via automated tooling in, e.g. a package manager.\\n\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n### Installation\\n\\nin-toto is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/in-toto/) and can be\\ninstalled via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). See\\n[in-toto.readthedocs.io](https://in-toto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html)\\nto learn about system dependencies and installation alternatives and\\nrecommendations.\\n\\n```shell\\npip install in-toto\\n```\\n### Create layout, run supply chain steps and verify final product\\n\\n#### Layout\\n\\nThe in-toto software supply chain layout consists of the following parts:\\n - **expiration date**\\n - **readme** (an optional description of the supply chain)\\n - **functionary keys** (public keys, used to verify link metadata signatures)\\n - **signatures** (one or more layout signatures created with the project owner key(s))\\n - **software supply chain steps**\\n   correspond to steps carried out by a functionary as part of the software supply chain. The steps defined in the layout list the functionaries who are authorized to carry out the step (by key id). Steps require a unique name to associate them (upon verification) with link metadata that is created when a functionary carries out the step using the `in-toto` tools. Additionally, steps must have material and product rules which define the files a step is supposed to operate on. Material and product rules are described in the section below.\\n - **inspections** define commands to be run during the verification process and can also list material and product rules.\\n\\nTake a look at the [demo layout creation example](https://in-toto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layout-creation-example.html)\\nfor further information on how to create an in-toto layout. Or try our\\nexperimental [layout creation web tool](https://in-toto.engineering.nyu.edu/).\\n\\n\\n\\n#### Artifact Rules\\nA software supply chain usually operates on a set of files, such as source code, executables, packages, or the like. in-toto calls these files artifacts. A material is an artifact that will be used when a step or inspection is carried out. Likewise, a product is an artifact that results from carrying out a step.\\n\\nThe in-toto layout provides a simple rule language to authorize or enforce the artifacts of a step and to chain them together. This adds the following guarantees for any given step or inspection:\\n- Only artifacts **authorized** by the project owner are created, modified or deleted,\\n- each defined creation, modification or deletion is **enforced**, and also\\n- restricted to the scope of its definition, which **chains** subsequent steps and inspections together.\\n\\nNote that it is up to you to properly secure your supply chain, by authorizing, enforcing and chaining materials and products using any and usually multiple of the following rules:\\n- `CREATE <pattern>`\\n- `DELETE <pattern>`\\n- `MODIFY <pattern>`\\n- `ALLOW <pattern>`\\n- `DISALLOW <pattern>`\\n- `REQUIRE <file>`\\n- `MATCH <pattern> [IN <source-path-prefix>] WITH (MATERIALS|PRODUCTS) [IN <destination-path-prefix>] FROM <step>`\\n\\n*Rule arguments specified as `<pattern>` allow for Unix shell-style wildcards as implemented by Python's [`fnmatch`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html).*\\n\\nin-toto's Artifact Rules, by default, allow artifacts to exist if they are not explicitly disallowed. As such, a `DISALLOW *` invocation is recommended as the final rule for most step definitions. To learn more about the different rule types, their guarantees and how they are applied, take a look at the [Artifact Rules](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md#433-artifact-rules) section of the in-toto specification.\\n\\n#### Carrying out software supply chain steps\\n\\n##### in-toto-run\\n`in-toto-run` is used to execute a step in the software supply chain. This can\\nbe anything relevant to the project such as tagging a release with `git`,\\nrunning a test, or building a binary. The relevant step name and command are\\npassed as arguments, along with materials, which are files required for that\\nstep's command to execute, and products which are files expected as a result\\nof the execution of that command. These, and other relevant details\\npertaining to the step are stored in a link file, which is signed using the\\nfunctionary's key.\\n\\nIf materials are not passed to the command, the link file generated just\\ndoesn't record them. Similarly, if the execution of a command via\\n`in-toto-run` doesn't result in any products, they're not recorded in the link\\nfile. Any files that are modified or used in any way during the execution of\\nthe command are not recorded in the link file unless explicitly passed as\\nartifacts. Conversely, any materials or products passed to the command are\\nrecorded in the link file even if they're not part of the execution\\nof the command.\\n\\nSee [this simple usage example from the demo application\\nfor more details](https://github.com/in-toto/demo).\\nFor a detailed list of all the command line arguments, run `in-toto-run --help`\\nor look at the [online\\ndocumentation](https://in-toto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-tools/in-toto-run.html).\\n\\n##### in-toto-record\\n`in-toto-record` works similar to `in-toto-run` but can be used for\\nmulti-part software supply chain steps, i.e. steps that are not carried out\\nby a single command. Use `in-toto-record start ...` to create a\\npreliminary link file that only records the *materials*, then run the\\ncommands of that step or edit files manually and finally use\\n`in-toto-record stop ...` to record the *products* and generate the actual\\nlink metadata file. For a detailed list of all command line arguments and their usage,\\nrun `in-toto-record start --help` or `in-toto-record stop --help`, or look at\\nthe [online\\ndocumentation](https://in-toto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-tools/in-toto-record.html).\\n\\n#### Release final product\\n\\nIn order to verify the final product with in-toto, the verifier must have access to the layout, the `*.link` files,\\nand the project owner's public key(s).\\n\\n#### Verification\\nUse `in-toto-verify` on the final product to verify that\\n- the layout was signed with the project owner's private key(s),\\n- has not expired,\\n- each step was performed and signed by the authorized functionary,\\n- the functionaries used the commands, they were supposed to use,\\n- materials and products of each step were in place as defined by the rules, and\\n- run the defined inspections\\n\\nFor a detailed list of all command line arguments and their usage, run\\n`in-toto-verify --help` or look at the\\n[online\\ndocumentation](https://in-toto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-tools/in-toto-verify.html).\\n\\n#### Signatures\\n`in-toto-sign` is a metadata signature helper tool to add, replace, and\\nverify signatures within in-toto Link or Layout metadata, with options to:\\n- replace (default) or add signature(s), with layout metadata able to be\\nsigned by multiple keys at once while link metadata can only be signed by one key at a time\\n- write signed metadata to a specified path (if no output path is specified,\\nlayout metadata is written to the path of the input file while link metadata\\nis written to `<name>.<keyid prefix>.link`)\\n- verify signatures\\n\\nThis tool is intended to sign layouts created by the\\n[layout web wizard](https://in-toto.engineering.nyu.edu/), but also serves\\nwell to re-sign test and demo data. For example, it can be used if metadata\\nformats or signing routines change.\\n\\nFor a detailed list of all command line arguments and their usage, run\\n`in-toto-sign --help` or look at the\\n[online\\ndocumentation](https://in-toto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-tools/in-toto-sign.html).\\n\\n\\n## in-toto demo\\nYou can try in-toto by running the [demo application](https://github.com/in-toto/demo).\\nThe demo basically outlines three users viz., Alice (project owner), Bob (functionary) and Carl (functionary) and how in-toto helps to specify a project layout and verify that the layout has been followed in a correct manner.\\n\\n## Specification\\nYou can read more about how in-toto works by taking a look at the\\n[specification](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md).\\n\\n\\n## Security Issues and Bugs\\nSee [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).\\n\\n\\n## Governance and Contributing\\n\\nFor information about in-toto's governance and contributing guidelines, see\\n[GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).\\n\\n## Acknowledgments\\nThis project is managed by Prof. Santiago Torres-Arias at Purdue University.\\nIt is worked on by many folks in academia and industry, including members of\\nthe [Secure Systems Lab](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/) at NYU and the\\n[NJIT Cybersecurity Research Center](https://centers.njit.edu/cybersecurity).\\n\\nThis research was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\\n(DARPA), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), and the US National Science\\nFoundation (NSF).

It also provides a flexible\\nframework for the remote attestation of any given `PCR` (Platform Configuration\\nRegister). Users can create their own customized actions that will trigger when\\na machine fails its attested measurements.\\n\\nKeylime\\'s mission is to make TPM Technology easily accessible to developers and\\nusers alike, without the need for a deep understanding of the lower levels of a\\nTPM\\'s operations. Amongst many scenarios, it well suited to tenants who need to\\nremotely attest machines not under their own full control (such as a consumer of\\nhybrid cloud or a remote Edge / IoT device in an insecure physical tamper prone\\nlocation.)\\n\\nKeylime can be driven with a CLI application and a set of RESTful APIs.\\n\\nKeylime consists of three main components; The Verifier, Registrar and the\\nAgent.\\n\\n* The Verifier continuously verifies the integrity state of the machine that\\nthe agent is running on.\\n\\n* The Registrar is a database of all agents registered\\nwith Keylime and hosts the public keys of the TPM vendors.\\n\\n* The Agent is deployed to the remote machine that is to be measured or provisioned\\nwith secrets stored within an encrypted payload released once trust is established.\\n\\n### Rust based Keylime Agent\\n\\nThe verifier, registrar, and agent are all developed in Python and situated\\nin this repository `keylime`. The agent was ported to the\\n[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org). The code can be found \\nin the [rust-keylime repository](https://github.com/keylime/rust-keylime).\\n\\nThe decision was made to port the agent to Rust, as rust is a low-level\\nperformant systems language designed with security as a central tenet, by means\\nof the rust compiler\\'s ownership model.\\n\\nStarting with the 0.1.0 release of the Rust based Keylime agent, this agent is now the official agent.\\n\\n| IMPORTANT: The Python version is deprecated and will be removed with the next major version (7.0.0)! |\\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n\\n\\n### TPM Support\\n\\nKeylime supports TPM version *2.0*.\\n\\nKeylime can be used with a hardware TPM, or a software TPM emulator for\\ndevelopment, testing, or demonstration purposes.  However, DO NOT USE Keylime in\\nproduction with a TPM emulator!  A software TPM emulator does not provide a\\nhardware root of trust and dramatically lowers the security benefits of using\\nKeylime.\\n\\nA hardware TPM should always be used when real secrets and trust is required.\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n* [Installation](#installation)\\n* [Usage](#usage)\\n  * [Configuring Keylime](#configuring-keylime)\\n  * [Running Keylime](#running-keylime)\\n  * [Provisioning](#provisioning)\\n* [Request a Feature](#request-a-feature)\\n* [Security Vulnerability Management Policy](#security-vulnerability-management-policy)\\n* [Meeting Information](#project-meetings)\\n* [Contributing: First Timers Support](#contributing--first-timers-support)\\n* [Testing](#testing)\\n* [Additional Reading](#additional-reading)\\n* [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nTo install Keylime refer to [the instructions found in the documentation](https://keylime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).\\n\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\n### Configuring Keylime\\n\\nKeylime puts its configuration in `/etc/keylime/*.conf` or `/usr/etc/keylime/*.conf`.\\nIt will also take an alternate location for the config in the environment var \\n`keylime_{VERIFIER,REGISTRAR,TENANT,CA,LOGGING}_CONFIG`.\\n\\nThose files are documented with comments and should be self-explanatory in most cases.\\n\\n### Running Keylime\\n\\nKeylime has three major component services that run: the registrar, verifier, and the agent:\\n\\n* The *registrar* is a simple HTTPS service that accepts TPM public keys.  It then\\npresents an interface to obtain these public keys for checking quotes.\\n\\n* The *verifier* is the most important component in Keylime.  It does initial and\\nperiodic checks of system integrity and supports bootstrapping a cryptographic key\\nsecurely with the agent.  The verifier uses mutual TLS for its control interface.\\n\\n    By default, the verifier will create appropriate TLS certificates for itself\\n    in `/var/lib/keylime/cv_ca/`.  The registrar and tenant will use this as well.  If\\n    you use the generated TLS certificates then all the processes need to run as root\\n    to allow reading of private key files in `/var/lib/keylime/`.\\n\\n* The *agent* is the target of bootstrapping and integrity measurements.  It puts\\n    its stuff into `/var/lib/keylime/`.\\n\\n\\n### Provisioning\\n\\nTo kick everything off you need to tell Keylime to provision a machine. This can be\\ndone with the Keylime tenant.\\n\\n#### Provisioning with keylime_tenant\\n\\nThe `keylime_tenant` utility can be used to provision your agent.\\n\\nAs an example, the following command tells Keylime to provision a new agent\\nat 127.0.0.1 with UUID d432fbb3-d2f1-4a97-9ef7-75bd81c00000 and talk to a\\nverifier at 127.0.0.1. Finally, it will encrypt a file called `filetosend`\\nand send it to the agent allowing it to decrypt it only if the configured TPM\\npolicy is satisfied:\\n\\n`keylime_tenant -c add -t 127.0.0.1 -v 127.0.0.1 -u D432fbb3-d2f1-4a97-9ef7-75bd81c00000 -f filetosend`\\n\\nTo stop Keylime from requesting attestations:\\n\\n`keylime_tenant -c delete -t 127.0.0.1 -u d432fbb3-d2f1-4a97-9ef7-75bd81c00000`\\n\\nFor additional advanced options for the tenant utility run:\\n\\n`keylime_tenant -h`\\n\\nDocumentation on how to create runtime and measured boot policies can be found in\\nthe [Keylime User Guide](https://keylime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html).\\n\\n## Systemd service support\\n\\nThe directory `services/` includes `systemd` service files for the verifier,\\nagent and registrar.\\n\\nYou can install the services with the following command:\\n\\n`sudo ./services/installer.sh`\\n\\nOnce installed, you can run and inspect the services `keylime_verifier` and `keylime_registrar` via `systemctl`.\\nThe Rust agent repository also contains a systemd service file for the agent.\\n\\n## Request a feature\\n\\nKeylime feature requests are tracked as enhancements in the [enhancements repository](https://github.com/keylime/enhancements)\\n\\nThe enhancement process has been implemented to provide a way to review and\\nassess the impact(s) of significant changes to Keylime.\\n\\n## Security Vulnerability Management Policy\\n\\nIf you have found a security vulnerability in Keylime and would like to\\nreport, first of all: thank you.\\n\\nPlease contact us directly at [security@keylime.groups.io](mailto:security@keylime.groups.io)\\nfor any bug that might impact the security of this project. **Do not** use a\\nGithub issue to report any potential security bugs.\\n\\n\\n## Project Meetings\\n\\nWe meet on the fourth Wednesday each month @ 15:30 GMT to 16:30. Anyone is welcome to join the meeting.\\n\\nThe meeting is normally announced on [CNCF chat (Slack)](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01ARE2QUTZ)\\n\\nMeeting agenda are hosted and archived in the [meetings repo](https://github.com/keylime/meetings) as GitHub issues.\\n\\n## Contributing: First Timers Support\\n\\nWe welcome new contributors to Keylime of any form, including those of you who maybe new to working in an open source project.\\n\\nSo if you are new to open source development, don\\'t worry, there are a myriad of ways you can get involved in our open source project.

Service keeps emulated TPM synchronized with IMA.\\n\\n#### Errata from the ACSAC Paper\\n\\nWe discovered a typo in Figure 5 of the published ACSAC paper. The final interaction\\nbetween the Tenant and Cloud Verifier showed an HMAC of the node\\'s ID using the key\\nK_e.  This should be using K_b. The paper in this repository and the ACSAC presentation\\nhave been updated to correct this typo.\\n\\nThe software that runs on the system with the TPM is now called the Keylime *agent* rather\\nthan the *node*.  We have made this change in the documentation and code.  The ACSAC paper\\nwill remain as it was published using *node*.\\n\\n## Disclaimer\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A.

It includes risk analysis, security compliance, and misconfiguration scanning. Targeted at the DevSecOps practitioner or platform engineer, it offers an easy-to-use CLI interface, flexible output formats, and automated scanning capabilities. It saves Kubernetes users and admins precious time, effort, and resources.\\n\\nKubescape scans clusters, YAML files, and Helm charts. It detects misconfigurations according to multiple frameworks (including [NSA-CISA](https://www.armosec.io/blog/kubernetes-hardening-guidance-summary-by-armo/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository), [MITRE ATT&CK®](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/23/secure-containerized-environments-with-updated-threat-matrix-for-kubernetes/) and the [CIS Benchmark](https://www.armosec.io/blog/cis-kubernetes-benchmark-framework-scanning-tools-comparison/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository)).\\n\\nKubescape was created by [ARMO](https://www.armosec.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository) and is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/).\\n\\n## Demo\\n<img src=\"docs/img/demo.gif\">\\n\\n_Please [star ⭐](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/stargazers) the repo if you want us to continue developing and improving Kubescape! 😀_\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\nExperimenting with Kubescape is as easy as:\\n\\n```sh\\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubescape/kubescape/master/install.sh | /bin/bash\\n```\\n\\nLearn more about:\\n\\n* [Installing Kubescape](docs/installation.md)\\n* [Running your first scan](docs/getting-started.md#run-your-first-scan)\\n* [Usage](docs/getting-started.md#examples)\\n* [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)\\n* [Building Kubescape from source](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/wiki/Building)\\n\\n_Did you know you can use Kubescape in all these places?_\\n\\n<div align=\"center\">\\n    <img src=\"docs/img/ksfromcodetodeploy.png\" alt=\"Places you can use Kubescape: in your IDE, CI, CD, or against a running cluster.\">\\n</div>\\n\\n## Under the hood\\n\\nKubescape uses [Open Policy Agent](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) to verify Kubernetes objects against [a library of posture controls](https://github.com/kubescape/regolibrary).\\n\\nBy default, the results are printed in a console-friendly manner, but they can be:\\n\\n* exported to JSON or junit XML\\n* rendered to HTML or PDF\\n* submitted to a [cloud service](docs/providers.md)\\n\\nIt retrieves Kubernetes objects from the API server and runs a set of [Rego snippets](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) developed by [ARMO](https://www.armosec.io?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository).\\n\\n## Community\\n\\nKubescape is an open source project, we welcome your feedback and ideas for improvement.

These\\nrules exist to answer questions like:\\n\\n* Can user X call operation Y on resource Z?\\n* What clusters should workload W be deployed to?\\n* What tags must be set on resource R before it's created?\\n\\nYou integrate services with OPA so that these kinds of policy decisions do not\\nhave to be *hardcoded* in your service. Services integrate with OPA by\\nexecuting _queries_ when policy decisions are needed.\\n\\nWhen you query OPA for a policy decision, OPA evaluates the rules and data\\n(which you give it) to produce an answer. The policy decision is sent back as\\nthe result of the query.\\n\\nFor example, in a simple API authorization use case:\\n\\n* You write rules that allow (or deny) access to your service APIs.\\n* Your service queries OPA when it receives API requests.\\n* OPA returns allow (or deny) decisions to your service.\\n* Your service _enforces_ the decisions by accepting or rejecting requests accordingly.\\n\\nFor concrete examples of how to integrate OPA with systems like [Kubernetes](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/kubernetes-admission-control.html), [Terraform](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/terraform.html), [Docker](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/docker-authorization.html), [SSH](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/ssh-and-sudo-authorization.html), and more, see [openpolicyagent.org](https://www.openpolicyagent.org).\\n\\n## Presentations\\n\\n- OPA maintainers talk @ Kubecon NA 2022: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMiovzGGCfI)\\n- Open Policy Agent (OPA) Intro & Deep Dive @ Kubecon EU 2022: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhyQxIp1H58)\\n- Open Policy Agent Intro @ KubeCon EU 2021: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CgeiWkliaw)\\n- Using Open Policy Agent to Meet Evolving Policy Requirements @ KubeCon NA 2020: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVuM7F_BTyc)\\n- Applying Policy Throughout The Application Lifecycle with Open Policy Agent @ CloudNativeCon 2019: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXfsaE6RKfc)\\n- Open Policy Agent Introduction @ CloudNativeCon EU 2018: [video](https://youtu.be/XEHeexPpgrA), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/opa-the-cloud-native-policy-engine)\\n- Rego Deep Dive @ CloudNativeCon EU 2018: [video](https://youtu.be/4mBJSIhs2xQ), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/rego-deep-dive)\\n- How Netflix Is Solving Authorization Across Their Cloud @ CloudNativeCon US 2017: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6tUNpRpdnY), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/how-netflix-is-solving-authorization-across-their-cloud).\\n- Policy-based Resource Placement in Kubernetes Federation @ LinuxCon Beijing 2017: [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/policybased-resource-placement-across-hybrid-cloud), [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRz13baBhfg&feature=youtu.be)\\n- Enforcing Bespoke Policies In Kubernetes @ KubeCon US 2017: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llDI8VvkUj8), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/enforcing-bespoke-policies-in-kubernetes)\\n- Istio's Mixer: Policy Enforcement with Custom Adapters @ CloudNativeCon US 2017: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czZLXUqzd24), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/TorinSandall/istios-mixer-policy-enforcement-with-custom-adapters-cloud-nativecon-17)\\n\\n## Security Audit\\n\\nA third party security audit was performed by Cure53, you can see the full report [here](SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf)\\n\\n## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities\\n\\nPlease report vulnerabilities by email to [open-policy-agent-security](mailto:open-policy-agent-security@googlegroups.com).\\nWe will send a confirmation message to acknowledge that we have received the\\nreport and then we will send additional messages to follow up once the issue\\nhas been investigated.\\n\",\n",

It currently supports PostgreSQL 14 and MySQL 8.\\n\\nIt offers an [HTTP API](https://openfga.dev/api/service) and a [gRPC API](https://buf.build/openfga/api/file/main:openfga/v1/openfga_service.proto). It has SDKs for [Node.js/JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfga/sdk), [GoLang](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk), [Python](https://github.com/openfga/python-sdk) and [.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenFga.Sdk). Look in our [Community section](https://github.com/openfga/community#community-projects) for third-party SDKs and tools.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nThe following section aims to help you get started quickly. Please look at our official [documentation](https://openfga.dev/) for in-depth information.\\n\\n### Setup and Installation\\n\\n> ℹ️ The following sections setup an OpenFGA server using the default configuration values. These are for rapid development and not for a production environment. Data written to an OpenFGA instance using the default configuration with the memory storage engine will *not* persist after the service is stopped.\\n>\\n> For more information on how to configure the OpenFGA server, please take a look at our official documentation on [Running in Production](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/running-in-production).\\n\\n#### Docker\\n\\nOpenFGA is available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openfga/openfga), so you can quickly start it using the in-memory datastore by running the following commands:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker pull openfga/openfga\\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 3000:3000 openfga/openfga run\\n```\\n\\n#### Docker Compose\\n\\n[`docker-compose.yaml`](./docker-compose.yaml) provides an example of how to launch OpenFGA with Postgres using `docker compose`.\\n\\n1. First, either clone this repo or curl the `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following command:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -LO https://openfga.dev/docker-compose.yaml\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Then, run the following command:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   docker compose up\\n   ```\\n\\n### Package Managers\\n\\nIf you are a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) user, you can install [OpenFGA](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/openfga) with the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nbrew install openfga\\n```\\n\\n#### Pre-compiled Binaries\\n\\nDownload your platform\\'s [latest release](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/latest) and extract it. Then run the binary\\nwith the command:\\n\\n```bash\\n./openfga run\\n```\\n\\n### Building from Source\\n\\nThere are two recommended options for building OpenFGA from source code:\\n\\n#### Building from source with `go install`\\n\\n> Make sure you have Go 1.20 or later installed. See the [Go downloads](https://go.dev/dl/) page.\\n\\nYou can install from source using Go modules:\\n\\n1. First, make sure `$GOBIN` is on your shell `$PATH`:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOBIN)\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Then use the install command:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   go install github.com/openfga/openfga/cmd/openfga\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Run the server with:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   ./openfga run\\n   ```\\n\\n#### Building from source with `go build`\\n\\nAlternatively you can build OpenFGA by cloning the project from this Github repo, and then building it with the `go build` command:\\n\\n1. Clone the repo to a local directory, and navigate to that directory:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   git clone https://github.com/openfga/openfga.git && cd openfga\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Then use the build command:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   go build -o ./openfga ./cmd/openfga\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Run the server with:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   ./openfga run\\n   ```\\n\\n### Verifying the Installation\\n\\nNow that you have [Set up and Installed](#setup-and-installation) OpenFGA, you can test your installation by [creating an OpenFGA Store](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/create-store).\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -X POST \\'localhost:8080/stores\\' \\\\\\n--header \\'Content-Type: application/json\\' \\\\\\n--data-raw \\'{\\n    \"name\": \"openfga-demo\"\\n}\\'\\n```\\n\\nIf everything is running correctly, you should get a response with information about the newly created store, for example:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"id\": \"01G3EMTKQRKJ93PFVDA1SJHWD2\",\\n  \"name\": \"openfga-demo\",\\n  \"created_at\": \"2022-05-19T17:11:12.888680Z\",\\n  \"updated_at\": \"2022-05-19T17:11:12.888680Z\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Playground\\nThe Playground facilitates rapid development by allowing you to visualize and model your application\\'s authorization model(s) and manage relationship tuples with a locally running OpenFGA instance.\\n\\nTo run OpenFGA with the Playground disabled, provide the `--playground-enabled=false` flag.\\n\\n```\\n./openfga run --playground-enabled=false\\n```\\nOnce OpenFGA is running, by default, the Playground can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/playground](http://localhost:3000/playground).\\n\\nIn the event that a port other than the default port is required, the `--playground-port` flag can be set to change it. For example,\\n\\n```sh\\n./openfga run --playground-enabled --playground-port 3001\\n```\\n\\n## Profiler (pprof)\\nProfiling through [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) can be enabled on the OpenFGA server by providing the `--profiler-enabled` flag.\\n\\n```sh\\n./openfga run --profiler-enabled\\n```\\n\\nThis will start serving profiling data on port `3001`. You can see that data by visiting `http://localhost:3001/debug/pprof`.\\n\\nIf you need to serve the profiler on a different address, you can do so by specifying the `--profiler-addr` flag. For example,\\n\\n```sh\\n./openfga run --profiler-enabled --profiler-addr :3002\\n```\\n\\nOnce the OpenFGA server is running, in another window you can run the following command to generate a compressed CPU profile:\\n\\n```sh\\ngo tool pprof -proto -seconds 60 http://localhost:3001/debug/pprof/profile\\n# will collect data for 60 seconds and generate a file like pprof.samples.cpu.001.pb.gz\\n```\\n\\nThat file can be analyzed visually by running the following command and then visiting `http://localhost:8084`:\\n\\n```shell\\ngo tool pprof -http=localhost:8084 pprof.samples.cpu.001.pb.gz\\n```\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nTake a look at examples of how to:\\n\\n- [Write an Authorization Model](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Authorization%20Models/WriteAuthorizationModel)\\n- [Write Relationship Tuples](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Tuples/Write)\\n- [Perform Authorization Checks](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Check)\\n- [Add Authentication to your OpenFGA server](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga#configuring-authentication)\\n\\nDon\\'t hesitate to browse the official [Documentation](https://openfga.dev/), [API Reference](https://openfga.dev/api/service).\\n\\n## Limitations\\n### MySQL Storage engine\\nThe MySQL storage engine has a lower length limit for some properties of a tuple compared with other storage backends. For more information see [the docs](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/docker#configuring-data-storage).\\n\\n## Production Readiness\\n\\nThe core [OpenFGA](https://github.com/openfga/openfga) service has been in use by [Auth0 FGA](https://fga.dev) in production since December 2021.\\n\\nOpenFGA\\'s Memory Storage Adapter was built for development purposes only and is not recommended for a production environment, because it is not designed for scalable queries and has no support for persistence.\\n\\nOpenFGA\\'s PostgreSQL Storage Adapter was purposely built for OpenFGA. Auth0 is not using it in a production environment.\\n\\nOpenFGA\\'s MySQL Storage Adapter was contributed to OpenFGA by [@twintag](https://github.com/twintag), who are using it in a production environment. Auth0 is not using it in a production environment.\\n\\nThe OpenFGA team will do its best to address all production issues with high priority.\\n\\nYou can learn about more organizations using OpenFGA in production [here](https://github.com/openfga/community/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md).

Make Your Containers Better, Smaller, More Secure and Do Less to Get There (free and open source!)\\n\\nNote that **DockerSlim** is now just **Slim** (**SlimToolkit** is the full name, so it\\'s easier to find it online) to show its growing support for additional container tools and runtimes in the cloud native ecosystem.\\n\\n**Slim** is now a CNCF Sandbox project. It was created by [Kyle](https://github.com/kcq) [Quest](https://twitter.com/kcqon) and it\\'s been improved by many [contributors](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/graphs/contributors). The project is supported by [Slim.AI](https://slim.ai).\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nSlim allows developers to inspect, optimize and debug their containers using its `xray`, `lint`, `build`, `debug` (and other) commands. It simplifies and improves your developer experience building, customizing and using containers. It makes your containers better, smaller and more secure while providing advanced visibility and improved usability working with the original and minified containers.\\n\\nDon\\'t change anything in your container image and minify it by up to 30x making it secure too! Optimizing images isn\\'t the only thing it can do though. It can also help you understand and author better container images.\\n\\nKeep doing what you are doing. No need to change anything. Use the base image you want. Use the package manager you want. Don\\'t worry about hand optimizing your Dockerfile. You shouldn\\'t have to throw away your tools and your workflow to have small container images.\\n\\nDon\\'t worry about manually creating Seccomp and AppArmor security profiles. You shouldn\\'t have to become an expert in Linux syscalls, Seccomp and AppArmor to have secure containers. Even if you do know enough about it wasting time reverse engineering your application behavior can be time-consuming.\\n\\nSlim will optimize and secure your containers by understanding your application and what it needs using various analysis techniques. It will throw away what you don\\'t need, reducing the attack surface of your container. What if you need some of those extra things to debug your container? You can use dedicated debugging side-car containers for that (more details below).\\n\\nUnderstand your container image before and after you optimize it using the `xray` command in the `slim` app or the [**Slim.AI SaaS**](https://portal.slim.dev/login?invitecode=invite.1s85zlfnYX0p5TT1XKja49pAHbL) where you can get even more powerful insights including how your container image changed.\\n\\nSlim has been used with Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, Rust, Elixir and PHP (some app types) running on Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Alpine and even Distroless.\\n\\nNote that some application stacks do require advanced container probing to make sure that all dynamically loaded components are detected. See the `--http-probe*` flags for more details to know how you can define custom probe commands. In some cases you might also need to use the `--include-path` flag to make sure everything your application needs is included (e.g., `ubuntu.com` python SPA app container image [example](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples/tree/master/3rdparty/ubuntu-com) where the client side template files are explicitly included).\\n\\nIt\\'s also a good idea to use your app/environment tests when you run the Slim app. See the `--continue-after` flag for more details about integrating your tests with the temporary container Slim creates when it\\'s doing its dynamic analysis. Running tests in the target container is also an option, but it does require you to specify a custom ENTRYPOINT/CMD with a custom wrapper to start your app and to execute your tests.\\n\\n![Slim How](assets/images/docs/SlimHow.jpeg)\\n\\nInteractive CLI prompt screencast:\\n\\n[![asciicast](assets/images/dslim/DockerSlimIntPromptDemo.gif)](https://asciinema.org/a/311513)\\n\\nWatch this screencast to see how an application image is minified by more than 30x.\\n\\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/rHqW8cbr3vXe0WxorHsD36n7V.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/rHqW8cbr3vXe0WxorHsD36n7V)\\n\\nWhen you run the `build` or `profile` commands in Slim it gives you an opportunity to interact with the temporary container it creates. By default, it will pause and wait for your input before it continues its execution. You can change this behavior using the `--continue-after` flag.\\n\\nIf your application exposes any web interfaces (e.g., when you have a web server or an HTTP API), you\\'ll see the port numbers on the host machine you will need to use to interact with your application (look for the `port.list` and `target.port.info` messages on the screen). For example, in the screencast above you\\'ll see that the internal application port 8000 is mapped to port 32911 on your host.\\n\\nNote that Slim will interact with your application for you when HTTP probing is enabled (enabled by default; see the `--http-probe*` flag docs for more details). Some web applications built with scripting languages like Python or Ruby require service interactions to load everything in the application. Enable HTTP probing unless it gets in your way.\\n\\nYou can also interact with the temporary container via a shell script or snippet using `--exec-file` or `--exec`. For example, you can create a container which is only capable of using curl.\\n\\n```bash\\n>> docker pull archlinux:latest\\n...\\n\\n>> slim build --target archlinux:latest --tag archlinux:curl --http-probe=false --exec \"curl checkip.amazonaws.com\"\\n...\\n\\n>> docker run archlinux:curl curl checkip.amazonaws.com\\n...\\n\\n>> docker images\\narchlinux                 curl                ...        ...         17.4MB\\narchlinux                 latest              ...        ...         467MB\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## Community\\n\\nFeel free to join any of these channels or just open a new [`Github issue`](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/issues) if you want to chat or if you need help.\\n\\n* [`CNCF Slack channel`](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C059QP1RH1S)\\n* [`Discord server`](https://discord.gg/9tDyxYS)\\n* [`Gitter channel`](https://gitter.im/docker-slim/community)\\n* [`Discussions`](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/discussions) (new)\\n* [`Twitter`](https://twitter.com/SlimToolkit)\\n* [`YouTube channel`](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy7RHjJlaBhpCCbChrd8POA)\\n\\n## Slim on the Internet\\n\\n##### Books:\\n* [`Everyone\\'s Docker/Kubernetes`](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/429710461X) (Japanese)\\n* [`Docker in Practice (2nd edition)`](https://www.amazon.com/Docker-Practice-Ian-Miell/dp/1617294802)\\n* [`Docker/Kubernetes Security Practice Guide`](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4839970505) (Japanese)\\n\\n\\n## Minification Examples\\n\\nYou can find the examples in a separate repository: [https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples)\\n\\nNode.js application images:\\n\\n- from ubuntu:14.04 -

It will help you understand and troubleshoot your application containers and a lot more. If you use the `xray` command you\\'ll want to try the SaaS. Understanding image changes is easy with its container diff capabilities. Connect your own registry and you can do the same with your own containers. Try it [here](https://portal.slim.dev/login?invitecode=invite.1s85zlfnYX0p5TT1XKja49pAHbL) without installing anything locally.\\n\\n\\n## BASIC USAGE INFO\\n\\n`slim [global flags] [xray|build|profile|run|debug|lint|merge|update|version|appbom|help] [command-specific flags] <IMAGE_ID_OR_NAME>`\\n\\nIf you don\\'t specify any command `slim` will start in the interactive prompt mode.\\n\\n### COMMANDS\\n\\n- `xray` - Performs static analysis for the target container image (including \\'reverse engineering\\' the Dockerfile for the image). Use this command if you want to know what\\'s inside of your container image and what makes it fat.\\n- `lint` - Analyzes container instructions in Dockerfiles (Docker image support is WIP)\\n- `build` - Analyzes, profiles and optimizes your container image generating the supported security profiles. This is the most popular command.\\n- `debug` - Debug the running target container. This command is useful for troubleshooting running containers created from minimal/minified or regular container images.\\n- `registry` - Execute registry operations.\\n- `profile` - Performs basic container image analysis and dynamic container analysis, but it doesn\\'t generate an optimized image.\\n- `run` - Runs one or more containers (for now runs a single container similar to `docker run`)\\n- `merge` - Merge two container images (optimized to merge minified images).\\n- `version` - Shows the version information.\\n- `appbom` - Shows the application BOM (app composition/dependencies).\\n- `update` - Updates Slim to the latest version.\\n- `help` - Show the available commands and global flags\\n\\nExample: `slim build my/sample-app`\\n\\nSee the `USAGE DETAILS` section for more details. Run `slim help` to get a high level overview of the available commands. Run `slim COMMAND_NAME` without any parameters and you\\'ll get more information about that command (e.g., `slim build`).\\n\\nIf you run `slim` without any parameters you\\'ll get an interactive prompt that will provide suggestions about the available commands and flags. `Tabs` are used to show the available options, to autocomplete the parameters and to navigate the option menu (which you can also do with Up and Down arrows). `Spaces` are used to move to the next parameter and `Enter` is used to run the command. For more info about the interactive prompt see [`go-prompt`](https://github.com/c-bata/go-prompt).\\n\\n## USAGE DETAILS\\n\\n`slim [global options] command [command options] <target image ID or name>`\\n\\nCommands:\\n\\n- `xray` - Show what\\'s in the container image and reverse engineer its Dockerfile\\n- `lint` - Lint the target Dockerfile (or image, in the future)\\n- `build` - Analyze the target container image along with its application and build an optimized image from it\\n- `debug` - Debug the running target container.

The host config parameters specified using their standalone build or profile command flags overwrite the values in the host config file (volume binds are merged).\\n- `--cro-sysctl` - Set namespaced kernel parameters in the created container (Container Runtime Option).\\n- `--cro-shm-size` - Shared memory size for /dev/shm in the created container (Container Runtime Option).\\n- `--use-local-mounts` - Mount local paths for target container artifact input and output (off, by default)\\n- `--use-sensor-volume` - Sensor volume name to use (set it to your Docker volume name if you manage your own Slim sensor volume).\\n- `--keep-tmp-artifacts` - Keep temporary artifacts when command is done (off, by default).\\n- `--keep-perms` - Keep artifact permissions as-is (default: true)\\n- `--run-target-as-user` - Run target app (in the temporary container) as USER from Dockerfile (true, by default)\\n- `--new-entrypoint` - New ENTRYPOINT instruction for the optimized image\\n- `--new-cmd` - New CMD instruction for the optimized image\\n- `--new-expose` - New EXPOSE instructions for the optimized image\\n- `--new-workdir` - New WORKDIR instruction for the optimized image\\n- `--new-env` - New ENV instructions for the optimized image\\n- `--new-label` - New LABEL instructions for the optimized image\\n- `--new-volume` - New VOLUME instructions for the optimized image\\n- `--remove-volume` - Remove VOLUME instructions for the optimized image\\n- `--remove-env` - Remove ENV instructions for the optimized image\\n- `--remove-label` - Remove LABEL instructions for the optimized image\\n- `--remove-expose` - Remove EXPOSE instructions for the optimized image\\n- `--exec` - A shell script snippet to run via Docker exec\\n- `--exec-file` - A shell script file to run via Docker exec\\n- `--sensor-ipc-mode` - Select sensor IPC mode: proxy | direct (useful for containerized CI/CD environments)\\n- `--sensor-ipc-endpoint` - Override sensor IPC endpoint\\n- `--rta-onbuild-base-image` - Enable runtime analysis for onbuild base images (default: false)\\n- `--rta-source-ptrace` - Enable PTRACE runtime analysis source (default: true)\\n- `--image-build-engine` - Select image build engine: `internal` | `docker` | `none` (`internal` - build the output image without using Docker [default behavior], `docker` - build the output image with Docker, `none` - don\\'t build the output image, allows you to do your own build with the tools you want to use, which you\\'ll be able to do by pointing to the artifact directory where the `files.tar` and `Dockerfile` artifacts are located for the output image)\\n- `--image-build-arch` - Select output image build architecture (use the standard container image names for the architectures without the OS part)\\n- `--obfuscate-metadata` - Obfuscate the standard system and application metadata to make it more challenging to identify the image components (experimental flag, first version of obfuscation; inspired by the [`Malicious Compliance`](https://kccnceu2023.sched.com/event/1Hybu/malicious-compliance-reflections-on-trusting-container-scanners-ian-coldwater-independent-duffie-cooley-isovalent-brad-geesaman-ghost-security-rory-mccune-datadog) KubeCon EU 2023 talk)\\n\\n\\nIn the interactive CLI prompt mode you must specify the target image using the `--target` flag while in the traditional CLI mode you can use the `--target` flag or you can specify the target image as the last value in the command.\\n\\nThe `--include-path` option is useful if you want to customize your minified image adding extra files and directories. The `--include-path-file` option allows you to load multiple includes from a newline delimited file. Use this option if you have a lot of includes. The includes from `--include-path` and `--include-path-file` are combined together. You can also use the `--exclude-pattern` flag to control what shouldn\\'t be included.\\n\\nThe `--continue-after` option is useful if you need to script the Slim app. If you pick the `probe` option then Slim will continue executing the build command after the HTTP probe is done executing. If you pick the `exec` options then Slim will continue executing the build command after the container exec shell commands (specified using the `--exec-file` or `--exec` flags) are done executing. If you pick the `timeout` option Slim will allow the target container to run for 60 seconds before it will attempt to collect the artifacts. You can specify a custom timeout value by passing a number of seconds you need instead of the `timeout` string. If you pick the `signal` option you\\'ll need to send a `USR1` signal to the Slim app process. The `signal` option is useful when you want to run your own tests against the temporary container Slim creates. Your test automation / CI/CD pipeline will be able to notify the Slim app that it\\'s done running its test by sending the `USR1` to it.\\n\\nYou can also combine multiple `continue-after` modes. For now only combining `probe` and `exec` is supported (using either `probe&exec` or `exec&probe` as the `--continue-after` flag value). Other combinations may work too. Combining `probe` and `signal` is not supported.\\n\\nThe `--include-shell` option provides a simple way to keep a basic shell in the minified container. Not all shell commands are included. To get additional shell commands or other command line utilities use the `--include-exe` and/or `--include-bin` options. Note that the extra apps and binaries might missed some of the non-binary dependencies (which don\\'t get picked up during static analysis). For those additional dependencies use the `--include-path` and `--include-path-file` options.\\n\\nThe `--dockerfile` option makes it possible to build a new minified image directly from source Dockerfile. Pass the Dockerfile name as the value for this flag and pass the build context directory or URL instead of the docker image name as the last parameter for the `build` command: `slim build --dockerfile Dockerfile --tag my/custom_minified_image_name .` If you want to see the console output from the build stages (when the fat and slim images are built) add the `--show-blogs` build flag. Note that the build console output is not interactive and it\\'s printed only after the corresponding build step is done. The fat image created during the build process has the `.fat` suffix in its name. If you specify a custom image tag (with the `--tag` flag) the `.fat` suffix is added to the name part of the tag. If you don\\'t provide a custom tag the generated fat image name will have the following format: `slim-tmp-fat-image.<pid_of_slim>.<current_timestamp>`. The minified image name will have the `.slim` suffix added to that auto-generated container image name (`slim-tmp-fat-image.<pid_of_slim>.<current_timestamp>.slim`). Take a look at this [python examples](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples/tree/master/python_ubuntu_18_py27_from_dockerfile) to see how it\\'s using the `--dockerfile` flag.\\n\\nThe `--use-local-mounts` option is used to choose how the Slim sensor is added to the target container and how the sensor artifacts are delivered back to the master. If you enable this option you\\'ll get the original Slim app behavior where it uses local file system volume mounts to add the sensor executable and to extract the artifacts from the target container. This option doesn\\'t always work as expected in the dockerized environment where Slim itself is running in a Docker container. When this option is disabled (default behavior) then a separate Docker volume is used to mount the sensor and the sensor artifacts are explicitly copied from the target container.\\n\\n### `DEBUG` COMMAND OPTIONS\\n\\n- `--runtime` - Runtime environment type (values: `docker`, `k8s`; defaults to `docker`)\\n- `--debug-image` - Debug image to use for the debug side-car container (default value for this flag is `busybox`).\\n- `--list-debug-images` - List possible debug images to use for the debug side-car container (for the `--debug-image` flag). This list is a ready to use set of debug images. You can use other images too.\\n- `--target` - Target container name or ID (this can also be provided as the last param in the command line invocation of the `debug` command). Note that the target container must be running. You can use the `docker run` command to start the target container (or the kubernetes equivalent).\\n- `--namespace` - Namespace to target [k8s runtime] (defaults to `default`)\\n- `--pod` - Pod to target [k8s runtime]\\n- `--cmd` - (Optional) custom CMD to use for the debug side-car container (alternatively pass custom CMD params after \\'--\\').\\n- `--entrypoint` - (Optional) custom ENTRYPOINT to use for the debug side-car container.\\n- `--terminal` - Attach interactive terminal to the debug container (default: true). When the interactive terminal is not enabled the debug container output will be printed out to the screen when the `debug` command exits.\\n- `--kubeconfig` - Kubeconfig file location [k8s runtime]\\n- `--workdir` - Custom WORKDIR to use for the debug side-car container.\\n- `--env` - Environment variable to add to the debug side-car container.\\n- `--run-as-target-shell` - Attach interactive terminal to the debug container and run shell as if it\\'s running in the target container environment.\\n- `--list-sessions` - List all debug sessions for the selected target (pod and optionally selected container for k8s or container for other runtimes).\\n- `--show-session-logs` - Show logs for the selected debug session (using namespace, pod, target container or debug session container name for k8s or debug session container name for other runtimes).\\n- `--session` - Debug session container name (used for debug sessoin actions).\\n- `--connect-session` - Connect to existing debug session.\\n- `--list-namespaces` - List names for available namespaces (use this flag by itself) [k8s runtime].\\n- `--list-pods` - List names for running pods in the selected namespace (use this flag by itself) [k8s runtime].\\n- `--list-debuggable-containers` - List container names for active containers that can be debugged (use this flag by itself).\\n- `--list-debug-images` - List possible debug images to use for the debug side-car container (use this flag by itself).\\n- `--help` show help (default: false)\\n\\nSee the \"Debugging Using the `debug` Command\" section for more information about this command.\\n\\n### `MERGE` COMMAND OPTIONS\\n\\n- `--image` - Image to merge. Flag instance position determines the merge order. The command supports two instances of this flag.\\n\\n- `--use-last-image-metadata` - Use only the last image metadata for the merged image.\\n\\n- `--tag` - Custom tags for the output image (multiple instances).\\n\\n### `REGISTRY` COMMAND OPTIONS\\n\\n#### `PULL` SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS\\n\\nUSAGE: `slim registry pull [IMAGE]`\\n\\n- `--target value` - Target container image (name or ID) [$DSLIM_TARGET]\\n- `--save-to-docker`- Save pulled image to docker (default: true) [$DSLIM_REG_PULL_SAVE_TO_DOCKER]\\n\\n#### `PUSH` SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS\\n\\nUSAGE: `slim registry push [IMAGE]`\\n\\n#### `COPY` SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS\\n\\nUSAGE: `slim registry copy [SRC_IMAGE] [DST_IMAGE]`\\n\\n## RUNNING CONTAINERIZED\\n\\nThe current version of Slim is able to run in containers. It will try to detect if it\\'s running in a containerized environment, but you can also tell Slim explicitly using the `--in-container` global flag.\\n\\nYou can run Slim in your container directly or you can use the Slim container image in your containerized environment. If you are using the Slim container image make sure you run it configured with the Docker IPC information, so it can communicate with the Docker daemon. The most common way to do it is by mounting the Docker unix socket to the Slim app container. Some containerized environments (like Gitlab and their `dind` service) might not expose the Docker unix socket to you, so you\\'ll need to make sure the environment variables used to communicate with Docker (e.g., `DOCKER_HOST`) are passed to the Slim app container. Note that if those environment variables reference any kind of local host names those names need to be replaced or you need to tell the Slim app about them using the `--etc-hosts-map` flag. If those environment variables reference local files those local files (e.g., files for TLS cert validation) will need to be copied to a temporary container, so that temporary container can be used as a data container to make those files accessible by the Slim app container.\\n\\nWhen Slim app runs in a container it will attempt to save its execution state in a separate Docker volume. If the volume doesn\\'t exist it will try to create it (`slim-state`, by default). You can pick a different state volume or disable this behavior completely by using the global `--archive-state` flag. If you do want to persist the Slim app execution state (which includes the `seccomp` and `AppArmor` profiles) without using the state archiving feature you can mount your own volume that maps to the `/bin/.slim-state` directory in the Slim app container.\\n\\nBy default, the Slim app will try to create a Docker volume for its sensor unless one already exists. If this behavior is not supported by your containerized environment you can create a volume separately and pass its name to the Slim app using the `--use-sensor-volume` flag.\\n\\nHere\\'s a basic example of how to use the containerized version of the Slim app:\\n`docker run -it --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock dslim/slim build your-docker-image-name`\\n\\nHere\\'s a GitLab example for their `dind` `.gitlab-ci.yml` config file:\\n`docker run -e DOCKER_HOST=tcp://$(grep docker /etc/hosts | cut -f1):2375 dslim/slim build your-docker-image-name`\\n\\nHere\\'s a CircleCI example for their `remote docker` `.circleci/config.yml` config file (used after the `setup_remote_docker` step):\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker create -v /dcert_path --name dcert alpine:latest /bin/true\\ndocker cp $DOCKER_CERT_PATH/. dcert:/dcert_path\\ndocker run --volumes-from dcert -e DOCKER_HOST=$DOCKER_HOST -e DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=$DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY -e DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/dcert_path dslim/slim build your-docker-image-name\\n```\\n\\nDifferent CI/CD services have different containerized environment designs that impose various restrictions that may impact the ability of the main app to communicate with the sensor app embedded in the temporary container Slim creates. Try adjusting the values for the `--sensor-ipc-mode` and `--sensor-ipc-endpoint` flags. This [`Google Cloud Build`](https://medium.com/google-cloud/integrating-dockerslim-container-minify-step-on-cloud-build-64da29fd58d1) blog post by Márton Kodok is a good reference for both of those flags. \\n\\n### Using `*-file` Flags\\n\\nThere are several flags that accept file paths (`--include-path-file`, `--compose-file`, `--http-probe-cmd-file`, etc). You need volume mount the location of the referenced paths or the file paths themselves when you use the containerized version of Slim because the Slim app container won\\'t have accept to the referenced files otherwise.\\n\\n## DOCKER CONNECT OPTIONS\\n\\nIf you don\\'t specify any Docker connect options the Slim app expects to find the Docker Unix socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) or the following environment variables: `DOCKER_HOST`, `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` (optional), `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` (required if `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` is set to `\"1\"`). Note that the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable can be used to point to a Unix socket address (in case the default Unix socket isn\\'t there). This is useful when you use Docker Desktop and you haven\\'t configured Docker Desktop to create the default Unix socket.\\n\\nIf the Docker environment variables are configured to use TLS and to verify the Docker cert (default behavior), but you want to disable the TLS verification you can override the TLS verification behavior by setting the `--tls-verify` to false:\\n\\n`slim --tls-verify=false build my/sample-node-app-multi`\\n\\nYou can override all Docker connection options using these flags: `--host`, `--tls`, `--tls-verify`, `--tls-cert-path`. These flags correspond to the standard Docker options (and the environment variables). Note that you can also use the `--host` flag (similar to `DOCKER_HOST`) to point to a Unix socket (e.g., `--host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock`).\\n\\nIf you want to use TLS with verification:\\n\\n`slim --host=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376 --tls-cert-path=/Users/youruser/.docker/machine/machines/default --tls=true --tls-verify=true build my/sample-node-app-multi`\\n\\nIf you want to use TLS without verification:\\n\\n`slim --host=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376 --tls-cert-path=/Users/youruser/.docker/machine/machines/default --tls=true --tls-verify=false build my/sample-node-app-multi`\\n\\nIf the Docker environment variables are not set and if you don\\'t specify any Docker connect options Slim will try to use the default unix socket.\\n\\n### DOCKER DESKTOP\\n\\nYou may not have the default Unix socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) configured if you use Docker Desktop. By default, Docker Desktop uses `~/.docker/run/docker.sock` as the Unix socket.\\n\\nYou can either use `--host` or `DOCKER_HOST` to point to the Docker Desktop\\'s Unix socket or you can configure Docker Desktop to create the default/traditional Unix socket (creating the `/var/run/docker.sock` symlink manually is an option too).\\n\\nTo configure Docker Desktop to create the default Unix socket open its UI and go to `Settings -> Advanced` where you need to check the `Enable default Docker socket (Requires password)` option.\\n\\n## HTTP PROBE COMMANDS\\n\\nIf the HTTP probe is enabled (note: it is enabled by default) it will default to running `GET /` with HTTP and then HTTPS on every exposed port. You can add additional commands using the `--http-probe-cmd` and `--http-probe-cmd-file` options.\\n\\nIf you want to disable HTTP probing set the `--http-probe` flag to false (e.g., `--http-probe=false`). You can also use the `--http-probe-off` flag to do the same (simply use the flag without any parameters).\\n\\nThe `--http-probe-cmd` option is good when you want to specify a small number of simple commands where you select some or all of these HTTP command options: crawling (defaults to false), protocol, method (defaults to GET), resource (path and query string).\\n\\nIf you only want to use custom HTTP probe command and you don\\'t want the default `GET /` command added to the command list you explicitly provided you\\'ll need to set `--http-probe` to false when you specify your custom HTTP probe command. Note that this inconsistency will be addressed in the future releases to make it less confusing.\\n\\nPossible field combinations:\\n* `/path` - runs `GET /path`\\n* `crawl:/path` - runs `GET /path` and then crawls the pages referenced by the target page\\n* `post:/path` - runs `POST /path`\\n* `crawl:get:/path` - runs `GET /path` and then crawls the pages referenced by the target page\\n* `https:get:/path` runs `GET /path` only on https\\n* `crawl:http:get:/path` - runs `GET /path` and then crawls the pages referenced by the target page\\n\\nHere are a couple of examples:\\n\\nAdds two extra probe commands: `GET /api/info` and `POST /submit` (tries http first, then tries https):\\n`slim build --show-clogs --http-probe-cmd /api/info --http-probe-cmd POST:/submit my/sample-node-app-multi`\\n\\nAdds one extra probe command: `POST /submit` (using only http):\\n`slim build --show-clogs --http-probe-cmd http:POST:/submit my/sample-node-app-multi`\\n\\nThe `--http-probe-cmd-file` option is good when you have a lot of commands and/or you want to select additional HTTP command options.\\n\\nAvailable HTTP command options:\\n* `method` - HTTP method to use\\n* `resource` - target resource URL\\n* `port` - port number\\n* `protocol` - `http`, `https`, `http2`, `http2c` (cleartext version of http2), `ws`, `wss` (secure websocket)\\n* `headers` - array of strings with column delimited key/value pairs (e.g., \"Content-Type: application/json\")\\n* `body` - request body as a string\\n* `body_file` - request body loaded from the provided file\\n* `username` - username to use for basic auth\\n* `password` - password to use for basic auth\\n* `crawl` - boolean to indicate if you want to crawl the target (to visit all referenced resources)\\n\\nHere\\'s a probe command file example:\\n\\n`slim build --show-clogs --http-probe-cmd-file probeCmds.json my/sample-node-app-multi`\\n\\nCommands in `probeCmds.json`:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \"commands\":\\n  [\\n   {\\n     \"resource\": \"/api/info\"\\n   },\\n   {\\n     \"method\": \"POST\",\\n     \"resource\": \"/submit\"\\n   },\\n   {\\n     \"procotol\": \"http\",\\n     \"resource\": \"/api/call?arg=one\"\\n   },\\n   {\\n     \"protocol\": \"http\",\\n     \"method\": \"POST\",\\n     \"resource\": \"/submit2\",\\n     \"body\": \"key=value\"\\n   },\\n   {\\n     \"protocol\": \"http\",\\n     \"method\": \"POST\",\\n     \"resource\": \"/submit3\",\\n     \"body_file\": \"mydata.json\",\\n     \"headers\": [\"Content-Type: application/json\"]\\n   }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe HTTP probe command file path can be a relative path (relative to the current working directory) or it can be an absolute path.\\n\\nFor each HTTP probe call Slim will print the call status. Example: `info=http.probe.call status=200 method=GET target=http://127.0.0.1:32899/ attempt=1 error=none`.\\n\\nYou can execute your own external HTTP requests using the `target.port.list` field in the container info message Slim prints when it starts its test container: `slim[build]: info=container name=<your_container_name> id=<your_container_id> target.port.list=[<comma_separated_list_of_port_numbers_to_use>] target.port.info=[<comma_separated_list_of_port_mapping_records>]`. Example: `slim[build]: info=container name=slimk_42861_20190203084955 id=aa44c43bcf4dd0dae78e2a8b3ac011e7beb6f098a65b09c8bce4a91dc2ff8427 target.port.list=[32899] target.port.info=[9000/tcp => 0.0.0.0:32899]`. With this information you can run `curl` or other HTTP request generating tools: `curl http://localhost:32899`.\\n\\nThe current version also includes an experimental `crawling` capability. To enable it for the default HTTP probe use the `--http-probe-crawl` flag. You can also enable it for the HTTP probe commands in your command file using the `crawl` boolean field.\\n\\nWhen `crawling` is enabled the HTTP probe will act like a web crawler following the links it finds in the target endpoint.\\n\\nProbing based on the Swagger/OpenAPI spec is another experimental capability. This feature introduces two new flags:\\n* `http-probe-apispec` - value: `<path_to_fetch_spec>:<api_endpoint_prefix>`\\n* `http-probe-apispec-file` - value: `<local_file_path_to_spec>`\\n\\nYou can use the `--http-probe-exec` and `--http-probe-exec-file` options to run the user provided commands when the http probes are executed. This example shows how you can run `curl` against the temporary container created by Slim when the http probes are executed.\\n\\n`slim build --http-probe-exec \\'curl http://localhost:YOUR_CONTAINER_PORT_NUM/some/path\\' --publish-port YOUR_CONTAINER_PORT_NUM your-container-image-name`\\n\\n\\n## DEBUGGING MINIFIED CONTAINERS\\n\\n### Debugging Using the `debug` Command\\n\\nThe current version of the `debug` command is pretty basic and it lacks a number of useful capabilities. It will help you debug containers running in Docker or Kubernetes (use the `--runtime` flag and set it to `k8s` if you need to debug a container in Kubernetes). \\n\\nBy default the `debug` command will provide you with an interactive terminal when it attaches the debugger side-car image to the debugged target container. Future versions will allow you to have different interaction modes with the target.\\n\\n#### The Debug Images\\n\\nYou can use any container image as a debug image, but there\\'s a list of pre-selected debug images you can choose.\\n\\nYou can list all pre-selected debug images with the `--list-debug-images` and if you are using the interactive prompt mode there\\'ll be an auto-complete dropdown menu for the `--debug-image` flag.\\n\\nHere\\'s the current list of debug images:\\n\\n* `cgr.dev/chainguard/slim-toolkit-debug:latest` - a general purpose SlimToolkit debug image created by Chainguard\\n* `cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base:latest` - a basic lightweight Wolfi image\\n* `busybox:latest` - a lightweight image with common unix utilities\\n* `nicolaka/netshoot` - a network trouble-shooting swiss-army container\\n* `lightruncom/koolkits:node` - a debug image for Node.js applications\\n* `lightruncom/koolkits:python` - a debug image for Python applications\\n* `lightruncom/koolkits:golang` - a debug image for Go applications\\n* `lightruncom/koolkits:jvm` - a debug image for Java applications\\n* `digitalocean/doks-debug:latest` - a kubernetes troubleshooting debug image\\n* `public.ecr.aws/zinclabs/debug-ubuntu-base:latest` - an image with common debugging utilities \\n\\n#### Steps to Debug Your Container (Kubernetes Runtime)\\n\\n1. Make sure the target environment you want to debug is up (the example k8s manifest creates a pod with the minimal nginx image from Chainguard and it has no shell):\\n```bash\\n\\n>> kubectl apply -f examples/k8s_nginx_cgr/manifest.yaml\\n\\n```\\n2. Run the debug command:\\n\\n```bash\\n\\n>> slim debug --runtime=k8s --pod=example-pod example-container\\n\\n```\\nor\\n```bash\\n\\n>> slim debug --runtime=k8s --pod=example-pod --target=example-container\\n\\n```\\n\\nNow you should have an interactive shell into the debug container started by `slim` and you can type your regular shell commands.\\n\\nBy default the `debug` command will connect the interactive terminal to the debugged container and it will run a shell as if it\\'s running in the target container environment, so you will see the file system of the target container as if you are directly connected (you won\\'t have to go through the `proc` file system). You can change this behavior by using the `--run-as-target-shell` (which is true by default). For example, this call will connect you to the debug container in a more traditional way: `slim debug --runtime=k8s --run-as-target-shell=false example-container`\\n\\nAlso note that if you use the interactive `prompt` mode (when you run `slim` with no command line parameters) you will get auto-complete behavior for a number of flags: `--target`, `--namespace`, `--pod`, `--session`.\\n\\nEach time you try to debug an image `slim` will have a session that represents it. You\\'ll be able to reconnect to the existing active debug sessions and you\\'ll be able to get logs from all available sessions.\\n\\n#### Steps to Debug Your Container (Docker Runtime) \\n\\n1. Start the target container you want to debug:\\n```bash\\n\\n>> docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 --name mycontainer nginx\\n\\n```\\n2. Run the debug command:\\n\\n```bash\\n\\n>> slim debug mycontainer\\n\\n```\\nor\\n```bash\\n\\n>> slim debug --target=mycontainer\\n\\n```\\n\\nNow you should have an interactive shell into the debug container started by `slim` and you can type your regular shell commands.\\n\\nBy default the `debug` command will connect the interactive terminal to the debugged container and it will run a shell as if it\\'s running in the target container environment, so you will see the file system of the target container as if you are directly connected (you won\\'t have to go through the `proc` file system). You can change this behavior by using the `--run-as-target-shell` (which is true by default). For example, this call will connect you to the debug container in a more traditional way: `slim debug --run-as-target-shell=false mycontainer`\\n\\nAlso note that if you use the interactive `prompt` mode (when you run `slim` with no command line parameters) you will get auto-complete behavior for a number of flags: `--target`, `--session`.\\n\\nEach time you try to debug an image `slim` will have a session that represents it. You\\'ll be able to reconnect to the existing active debug sessions and you\\'ll be able to get logs from all available sessions.\\n\\n### Debugging the \"Hard Way\" (Docker Runtime)\\n\\nYou can create dedicated debugging side-car container images loaded with the tools you need for debugging target containers. This allows you to keep your production container images small. The debugging side-car containers attach to the running target containers.\\n\\nAssuming you have a running container named `node_app_alpine` you can attach your debugging side-car with a command like this: `docker run --rm -it --pid=container:node_app_alpine --net=container:node_app_alpine --cap-add sys_admin alpine sh`. In this example, the debugging side-car is a regular alpine image. This is exactly what happens with the `node_alpine` app sample (located in the `node_alpine` directory of the `examples` repo) and the `run_debug_sidecar.command` helper script.\\n\\nIf you run the `ps` command in the side-car you\\'ll see the application from the target container:\\n\\n```\\n# ps\\nPID   USER     TIME   COMMAND\\n    1 root       0:00 node /opt/my/service/server.js\\n   13 root       0:00 sh\\n   38 root       0:00 ps\\n```\\n\\nYou can access the target container file system through `/proc/<TARGET_PID>/root`:\\n\\n```\\n# ls -lh /proc/1/root/opt/my/service\\ntotal 8\\ndrwxr-xr-x    3 root     root        4.0K Sep  2 15:51 node_modules\\n-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         415 Sep  8 00:52 server.js\\n```\\n\\nSome of the useful debugging commands include `cat /proc/<TARGET_PID>/cmdline`, `ls -l /proc/<TARGET_PID>/cwd`, `cat /proc/1/environ`, `cat /proc/<TARGET_PID>/limits`, `cat /proc/<TARGET_PID>/status` and `ls -l /proc/<TARGET_PID>/fd`.\\n\\n\\n## MINIFYING COMMAND LINE TOOLS\\n\\nUnless the default CMD instruction in your Dockerfile is sufficient you\\'ll have to specify command line parameters when you execute the `build` command in Slim. This can be done with the `--cmd` option.\\n\\nOther useful command line parameters:\\n\\n- `--show-clogs` - use it if you want to see the output of your container.\\n- `--mount` - use it to mount a volume when Slim inspects your image.\\n- `--entrypoint` - use it if you want to override the ENTRYPOINT instruction when Slim inspects your image.\\n\\nNote that the `--entrypoint` and `--cmd` options don\\'t override the `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` instructions in the final minified image.\\n\\nHere\\'s a sample `build` command:\\n\\n`slim build --show-clogs=true --cmd docker-compose.yml --mount $(pwd)/data/:/data/ dslim/container-transform`\\n\\nIt\\'s used to minify the `container-transform` tool. You can get the minified image from [`Docker Hub`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dslim/container-transform.slim/).\\n\\n## QUICK SECCOMP EXAMPLE\\n\\nIf you want to auto-generate a Seccomp profile AND minify your image use the `build` command. If you only want to auto-generate a Seccomp profile (along with other interesting image metadata) use the `profile` command.\\n\\nStep one: run Slim\\n\\n`slim build your-name/your-app`\\n\\nStep two: use the generated Seccomp profile\\n\\n`docker run --security-opt seccomp:<slim directory>/.images/<YOUR_APP_IMAGE_ID>/artifacts/your-name-your-app-seccomp.json <your other run params> your-name/your-app`\\n\\nFeel free to copy the generated profile :-)\\n\\nYou can use the generated Seccomp profile with your original image or with the minified image.\\n\\n## USING AUTO-GENERATED SECCOMP PROFILES\\n\\nYou can use the generated profile with your original image or with the minified image Slim created:\\n\\n`docker run -it --rm --security-opt seccomp:path_to/my-sample-node-app-seccomp.json -p 8000:8000 my/sample-node-app.slim`\\n\\n## ORIGINAL DEMO VIDEO\\n\\n[![DockerSlim demo](http://img.youtube.com/vi/uKdHnfEbc-E/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKdHnfEbc-E)\\n\\n[Demo video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/uKdHnfEbc-E)\\n\\n## DEMO STEPS\\n\\nThe demo runs on Mac OS X, but you can build a linux version. Note that these steps are different from the steps in the demo video.\\n\\n1. Get the Slim app binaries:\\n\\n* [Mac](https://downloads.dockerslim.com/releases/1.40.4/dist_mac.zip),\\n* [Mac M1](https://downloads.dockerslim.com/releases/1.40.4/dist_mac_m1.zip), \\n* [Linux](https://downloads.dockerslim.com/releases/1.40.4/dist_linux.tar.gz), \\n* [Linux ARM](https://downloads.dockerslim.com/releases/1.40.4/dist_linux_arm.tar.gz),\\n* [Linux ARM64](https://downloads.dockerslim.com/releases/1.40.4/dist_linux_arm64.tar.gz) \\n\\nUnzip them and optionally add their directory to your `PATH` environment variable if you want to use the app from other locations.\\n\\nThe extracted directory contains two binaries (and now it also contains a symlink for the old name):\\n\\n- `slim` <- the main Slim application binary\\n- `slim-sensor` <- the sensor application used to collect information from running containers\\n- `docker-slim` <- the symlink to `slim`, the new main app binary (useful if you are still using the old name in your scripts)\\n\\n2. Clone the `examples` repo to use the sample apps (note: the examples have been moved to a separate repo). You can skip this step if you have your own app.\\n\\n`git clone https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples.git`\\n\\n3. Create a Docker image for the sample node.js app in `examples/node_ubuntu`. You can skip this step if you have your own app.\\n\\n`cd examples/node_ubuntu`\\n\\n`docker build -t my/sample-node-app .`\\n\\n4. Run the Slim app:\\n\\n`./slim build my/sample-node-app` <- run it from the location where you extraced the Slim app binaries (or update your `PATH` env var to include the directory where the Slim app binaries are located)\\n\\nSlim creates a special container based on the target image you provided. It also creates a resource directory where it stores the information it discovers about your image: `<slim directory>/.images/<TARGET_IMAGE_ID>`.\\n\\nBy default, the Slim app will run its http probe against the temporary container. If you are minifying a command line tool that doesn\\'t expose any web service interface you\\'ll need to explicitly disable http probing (by setting `--http-probe=false`).\\n\\n5. Use curl (or other tools) to call the sample app (optional)\\n\\n`curl http://<YOUR_DOCKER_HOST_IP>:<PORT>`\\n\\nThis is an optional step to make sure the target app container is doing something. Depending on the application it\\'s an optional step. For some applications it\\'s required if it loads new application resources dynamically based on the requests it\\'s processing (e.g., Ruby or Python).\\n\\nYou\\'ll see the mapped ports printed to the console when the Slim app starts the target container. You can also get the port number either from the `docker ps` or `docker port <CONTAINER_ID>` commands. The current version of DockerSlim doesn\\'t allow you to map exposed network ports (it works like `docker run … -P`).\\n\\n6. Press <enter> and wait until the Slim app says it\\'s done\\n\\nBy default or when http probing is enabled explicitly the Slim app will continue its execution once the http probe is done running. If you explicitly picked a different `continue-after` option follow the expected steps. For example, for the `enter` `continue-after` option you must press the `enter` button on your keyboard.\\n\\nIf http probing is enabled (when `http-probe` is set) and if `continue-after` is set to `enter` and you press the `enter` key before the built-in HTTP probe is done the probe might produce an EOF error because the Slim app will shut down the target container before all probe commands are done executing. It\\'s ok to ignore it unless you really need the probe to finish.\\n\\n7. Once Slim is done check that the new minified image is there\\n\\n`docker images`\\n\\nYou should see `my/sample-node-app.slim` in the list of images. Right now all generated images have `.slim` at the end of its name.\\n\\n8. Use the minified image\\n\\n`docker run -it --rm --name=\"slim_node_app\" -p 8000:8000 my/sample-node-app.slim`\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### Is it safe for production use?\\n\\nYes! Either way, you should test your Docker images.\\n\\n### How can I contribute if I don\\'t know Go?\\n\\nYou don\\'t need to read the language spec and lots of books :-) Go through the [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) and optionally read [50 Shades of Go](http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/) and you\\'ll be ready to contribute!\\n\\n### What\\'s the best application for Slim?\\n\\nSlim will work for any containerized application; however, Slim automates app interactions for applications with an HTTP API. You can use Slim even if your app doesn\\'t have an HTTP API. You\\'ll need to interact with your application manually to make sure Slim can observe your application behavior.\\n\\n### Can I use Slim with dockerized command line tools?\\n\\nYes. The `--cmd`, `--entrypoint`, and `--mount` options will help you minify your image. The `container-transform` tool is a good example.\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nYou can explore the artifacts Slim generates when it\\'s creating a slim image. You\\'ll find those in `<slim directory>/.images/<TARGET_IMAGE_ID>/artifacts`. One of the artifacts is a \"reverse engineered\" Dockerfile for the original image. It\\'ll be called `Dockerfile.fat`.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to see the artifacts without running the Slim app you can take a look at the `examples/artifacts` directory in this repo. It doesn\\'t include any image files, but you\\'ll find:\\n\\n- a reverse engineered Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.fat`)\\n- a container report file (`creport.json`)\\n- a sample AppArmor profile (which will be named based on your original image name)\\n- and a sample Seccomp profile\\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to create a minified image and only want to \"reverse engineer\" the Dockerfile you can use the `info` command.\\n\\n### What if my Docker images uses the USER command?\\n\\nThe current version of Slim does include support for non-default users (take a look at the non-default user examples (including the ElasticSearch example located in the `3rdparty` directory) in the [`examples`](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/examples) repo. Please open tickets if something doesn\\'t work for you.\\n\\nEverything should work as-is, but for the special cases where the current behavior don\\'t work as expected you can adjust what Slim does using various `build` command parameters: `--run-target-as-user`, `--keep-perms`, `--path-perms`, `--path-perms-file` (along with the `--include-*` parameters).\\n\\nThe `--run-target-as-user` parameter is enabled by default and it controls if the application in the temporary container is started using the identity from the USER instruction in the container\\'s Dockerfile.\\n\\nThe `--keep-perms` parameter is also enabled by default. It tells Slim to retain the permissions and the ownership information for the files and directories copied to the optimized container image.\\n\\nThe `--path-perms` and `--path-perms-file` parameters are similar to the `--include-path` and `--include-path-file` parameters. They are used to overwrite the permission and the user/group information for the target files and directories. Note that the target files/directories are expected to be in the optimized container image. If you don\\'t know if the target files/directories will be in the optimized container you\\'ll need to use one of the `--include-*` parameters (e.g., `--include-path-file`) to explicitly require those artifacts to be included. You can specify the permissions and the ownership information in the `--include-*` parameters too (so you don\\'t need to have the `--path-*` parameters just to set the permissions).\\n\\nThe `--path-*` and `--include-*` params use the same format to communicate the permission/owernship info: `TARGET_PATH_OR_NAME:PERMS_IN_OCTAL_FORMAT#USER_ID#GROUP_ID`.\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to specify the user and group IDs if you don\\'t want to change them.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example using these parameters to minify the standard `nginx` image adding extra artifacts and changing their permissions: `slim build --include-path=\\'/opt:770#104#107\\' --include-path=\\'/bin/uname:710\\' --path-perms=\\'/tmp:700\\' nginx`.\\n\\nThis is what you\\'ll see in the optimized container image:\\n\\n```\\ndrwx------  0 0      0           0 Feb 28 22:15 tmp/\\n-rwx--x---  0 0      0       31240 Mar 14  2015 bin/uname\\ndrwxrwx---  0 104    107         0 Feb 28 22:13 opt/\\n```\\n\\nThe `uname` binary isn\\'t used by nginx, so the `--include-path` parameter is used to keep it in the optimized image changing its permissions to `710`.\\n\\nThe `/tmp` directory will be included in the optimized image on its own, so the `--path-perms` parameter is used to change its permissions to `700`.\\n\\nWhen you set permissions/user/group on a directory the settings are only applied to that directory and not to the artifacts inside. The future versions will allow you to apply the same settings to everything inside the target directory too.\\n\\nAlso note that for now you have to use numeric user and group IDs. The future versions will allow you to use user and group names too.\\n\\n### Nginx fails in my minified image\\n\\nIf you see `nginx: [emerg] mkdir() \"/var/lib/nginx/body\" failed` it means your nginx setup uses a non-standard temporary directory. Nginx will fail if the base directory for its temporary folders doesn\\'t exist (they won\\'t create the missing intermediate directories). Normally it\\'s `/var/lib/nginx`, but if you have a custom config that points to something else you\\'ll need to add an `--include-path` flag as an extra flag when you run the Slim app.\\n\\n### Slim fails with a \\'no permission to read from\\' error\\n\\nThis problem shouldn\\'t happen anymore because the exported artifacts are saved in a tar file and the master app doesn\\'t need to access the files directly anymore.\\n\\nIf you run older versions of Slim you can get around this problem by running Slim from a root shell. That way it will have access to all exported files.\\n\\nSlim copies the relevant image artifacts trying to preserve their permissions. If the permissions are too restrictive the master app might not have sufficient priviledge to access these files when it\\'s building the new minified image.\\n\\n## BUILD PROCESS\\n\\n#### Build Options\\n\\nPick one of the build options that works best for you.\\n\\n##### Containerized\\n\\nRun `make build_in_docker` on linux or `make build_m1_in_docker` on Macs (or `./scripts/docker-builder.run.sh` or click on `./scripts/mac/docker-builder.run.command` on Macs) from the project directory (builds Slim in a Docker container; great if you don\\'t want to install Go on your local machine and if you already have Docker).\\n\\n##### Native\\n\\nRun `make build` on linux or `make build_m1` on Macs (or `./scripts/src.build.sh` or click on `./scripts/mac/src.build.command` on Macs) to build Slim natively (requires Go installed locally).\\n\\nNote:\\n\\nTry using the latest version of Go building the Slim app. The current version of Go used to build the Slim app is 1.19.\\n\\n##### Gitpod\\n\\nIf you have a web browser, you can get a fully pre-configured development environment in one click:\\n\\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim)\\n\\n\\n##### Additional Tools\\n\\n- `license-bill-of-materials` - Optional tool to track dependencies and their licenses.\\n- `golint` - Optional tool for code analysis. See `https://github.com/golang/lint` for more details.\\n\\nYou can install these tools using the `tools.get.sh` shell script in the `scripts` directory.\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n- Make sure you have `golint` if you intend to run the `src.inspect.sh` or `mac.src.inspect.command` scripts.\\n\\n## CONTRIBUTING\\n\\nIf the project sounds interesting or if you found a bug see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) and submit a PR or open an issue! Non-code contributions including docs are highly appreciated! Open an issue even if you have a question or something is not clear.\\n\\n## DESIGN\\n\\nTo learn more about the code take a look at this [interactive code diagram](https://app.codesee.io/maps/public/1cedd540-6451-11ec-a279-0572ca5abbdc) generated using [CodeSee](https://www.codesee.io) and watch the `Slim Code` videos on [\\'YouTube\\'](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy7RHjJlaBhpCCbChrd8POA?sub_confirmation=1).\\n\\n### CORE CONCEPTS\\n\\n1. Inspect container metadata (static analysis)\\n2. Inspect container data (static analysis)\\n3. Inspect running application (dynamic analysis)\\n4. Build an application artifact graph\\n5. Use the collected application data to build small images\\n6. Use the collected application data to auto-generate various security framework configurations.\\n\\n### DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OPTIONS\\n\\n1. Instrument the container image (and replace the entrypoint/cmd) to collect application activity data\\n2. Use kernel-level tools that provide visibility into running containers (without instrumenting the containers)\\n3. Disable relevant namespaces in the target container to gain container visibility (can be done with runC)\\n\\n### SECURITY\\n\\nThe goal is to auto-generate Seccomp, AppArmor, (and potentially SELinux) profiles based on the collected information.\\n\\n- AppArmor profiles\\n- Seccomp profiles\\n\\n### CHALLENGES\\n\\nSome of the advanced analysis options require a number of Linux kernel features that are not always included. The kernel you get with Docker Machine / Boot2docker is a great example of that.\\n\\n## ORIGINS\\n\\nDockerSlim was a `Docker Global Hack Day` \\\\#`dockerhackday` project. It barely worked at the time, but it did get a win in Seattle and it took the second place in the `Plumbing` category overall :-)\\n\\n![DHD3](assets/images/dhd/docker_global_hackday3_red.png)\\n\\nSince then it\\'s been improved and it works pretty well for its core use cases. It can be better though. That\\'s why the project needs your help! You don\\'t need to know much about the container internals, container runtimes and you don\\'t need to know anything about Go. You can contribute in many different ways. For example, use Slim on your images and open Github issues documenting your experience even if it worked just fine :-)\\n\\n## LICENSE\\n\\nApache License v2, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/slimtoolkit/slim/blob/master/LICENSE) for details.\\n\\n## CODE OF CONDUCT\\n\\nThe project follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**We are a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) sandbox project.**\\n\\n<img src=\"assets/images/cncf/cncf.svg\" width=300 />\\n\\n---\\n\\n[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/slimtoolkit/slim)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/slimtoolkit/slim)\\n\\n',\n",

The name “Athenz” is derived from “AuthNZ” (N for authentication and Z for authorization).\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n* [Background](#background)\\n* [Install](#install)\\n* [Usage](#usage)\\n* [Contribute](#contribute)\\n* [License](#license)\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nAthenz is an open source platform for X.509 certificate based service authentication\\nand fine-grained role based access control in dynamic infrastructures. It provides\\nsupport for the following three major functional areas.\\n\\n### Service Authentication\\n\\nAthenz provides secure identity in the form of short lived X.509 certificate\\nfor every workload or service deployed in private (e.g. Openstack, K8S, Screwdriver)\\nor public cloud (e.g. AWS EC2, ECS, Fargate, Lambda). Using these X.509 certificates\\nclients and services establish secure connections and through mutual TLS authentication verify\\neach other's identity. The service identity certificates are valid for 30 days only,\\nand the service identity agents (SIA) part of those frameworks automatically refresh\\nthem daily. The term service within Athenz is more generic than a traditional service.\\nA service identity could represent a command, job, daemon, workflow, as well as both an\\napplication client, and an application service.\\n\\nSince Athenz service authentication is based on\\n[X.509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509), it is\\nimportant that you have a good understanding what X.509 certificates are\\nand how they're used to establish secure connections in Internet protocols\\nsuch as [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security).\\n\\n### Role-Based Authorization (RBAC)\\n\\nOnce the client is authenticated with its x.509 certificate, the service\\ncan then check if the given client is authorized to carry out the requested\\naction. Athenz provides fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) support\\nfor a centralized management system with support for control-plane access control\\ndecisions and a decentralized enforcement mechanism suitable for data-plane\\naccess control decisions. It also provides a delegated management model that\\nsupports multi-tenant and self-service concepts.\\n\\n### AWS Temporary Credentials Support\\n\\nWhen working with AWS, Athenz provides support to access AWS services\\nfrom on-prem services with using AWS temporary credentials rather than\\nstatic credentials.

SPIRE exposes the [SPIFFE Workload API](https://github.com/spiffe/go-spiffe/blob/main/v2/proto/spiffe/workload/workload.proto), which can attest running software systems and issue [SPIFFE IDs](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE-ID.md) and [SVID](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE-ID.md)s to them.  This in turn allows two workloads to establish trust between each other, for example by establishing an mTLS connection or by signing and verifying a JWT token. SPIRE can also enable workloads to securely authenticate to a secret store, a database, or a cloud provider service.\\n\\n- [Get SPIRE](#get-spire)\\n- [Learn about SPIRE](#learn-about-spire)\\n- [Integrate with SPIRE](#integrate-with-spire)\\n- [Contribute to SPIRE](#contribute-to-spire)\\n- [Further Reading](#further-reading)\\n- [Security](#security)\\n\\nSPIRE is a [graduated](https://www.cncf.io/projects/spire/) project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF).

This is a `.teller.yml` file that lives in your repo, or one that you point teller to with `teller -c your-conf.yml`.\\n\\n## Using a Github Action\\n\\nFor those using Github Action, you can have a 1-click experience of installing Teller in your CI:\\n\\n```yaml\\n- name: Setup Teller\\n  uses: spectralops/setup-teller@v1\\n- name: Run a Teller task (show, scan, run, etc.)\\n  run: teller run [args]\\n```\\n\\nFor more, check our [setup teller action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-teller) on the marketplace.\\n\\n## Create your configuration\\n\\nRun `teller new` and follow the wizard, pick the providers you like and it will generate a `.teller.yml` for you.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can use the following minimal template or [view a full example](.teller.example.yml):\\n\\n```yaml\\nproject: project_name\\nopts:\\n  stage: development\\n\\n# remove if you don\\'t like the prompt\\nconfirm: Are you sure you want to run in {{stage}}?\\n\\nproviders:\\n  # uses environment vars to configure\\n  # https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/blob/api/v1.0.4/api/client.go#L28\\n  hashicorp_vault:\\n    env_sync:\\n      path: secret/data/{{stage}}/services/billing\\n\\n  # this will fuse vars with the below .env file\\n  # use if you\\'d like to grab secrets from outside of the project tree\\n  dotenv:\\n    env_sync:\\n      path: ~/billing.env.{{stage}}\\n```\\n\\nNow you can just run processes with:\\n\\n```\\n$ teller run node src/server.js\\nService is up.\\nLoaded configuration: Mailgun, SMTP\\nPort: 5050\\n```\\n\\nBehind the scenes: `teller` fetched the correct variables, placed those (and _just_ those) in `ENV` for the `node` process to use.\\n\\n# Best practices\\n\\nGo and have a look at a collection of our [best practices](./best-practices.md)\\n\\n# Features\\n\\n## :running: Running subprocesses\\n\\nManually exporting and setting up environment variables for running a process with demo-like / production-like set up?\\n\\nGot bitten by using `.env.production` and exposing it in the local project itself?\\n\\nUsing `teller` and a `.teller.yml` file that exposes nothing to the prying eyes, you can work fluently and seamlessly with zero risk, also no need for quotes:\\n\\n```\\n$ teller run -- your-process arg1 arg2... --switch1 ...\\n```\\n\\n## :mag_right: Inspecting variables\\n\\nThis will output the current variables `teller` picks up. Only first 2 letters will be shown from each, of course.\\n\\n```\\n$ teller show\\n```\\n\\n## :tv: Local shell population\\n\\nHardcoding secrets into your shell scripts and dotfiles?\\n\\nIn some cases it makes sense to eval variables into your current shell. For example in your `.zshrc` it makes much more sense to use `teller`, and not hardcode all those into the `.zshrc` file itself.\\n\\nIn this case, this is what you should add:\\n\\n```\\neval \"$(teller sh)\"\\n```\\n\\n## :whale: Easy Docker environment\\n\\nTired of grabbing all kinds of variables, setting those up, and worried about these appearing in your shell history as well?\\n\\nUse this one liner from now on:\\n\\n```\\n$ docker run --rm -it --env-file <(teller env) alpine sh\\n```\\n\\n## :warning: Scan for secrets\\n\\nTeller can help you fight secret sprawl and hard coded secrets, as well as be the best productivity tool for working with your vault.\\n\\nIt can also integrate into your CI and serve as a shift-left security tool for your DevSecOps pipeline.\\n\\nLook for your vault-kept secrets in your code by running:\\n\\n```\\n$ teller scan\\n```\\n\\nYou can run it as a linter in your CI like so:\\n\\n```\\nrun: teller scan --silent\\n```\\n\\nIt will break your build if it finds something (returns exit code `1`).\\n\\nUse Teller for productively and securely running your processes and you get this for free -- nothing to configure. If you have data that you\\'re bringing that you\\'re sure isn\\'t sensitive, flag it in your `teller.yml`:\\n\\n```\\ndotenv:\\n  env:\\n    FOO:\\n      path: ~/my-dot-env.env\\n      severity: none # will skip scanning. possible values: high | medium | low | none\\n```\\n\\nBy default we treat all entries as sensitive, with value `high`.\\n\\n## :recycle: Redact secrets from process outputs, logs, and files\\n\\nYou can use `teller` as a redaction tool across your infrastructure, and run processes while redacting their output as well as clean up logs and live tails of logs.\\n\\nRun a process and redact its output in real time:\\n\\n```\\n$ teller run --redact -- your-process arg1 arg2\\n```\\n\\nPipe any process output, tail or logs into teller to redact those, live:\\n\\n```\\n$ cat some.log | teller redact\\n```\\n\\nIt should also work with `tail -f`:\\n\\n```\\n$ tail -f /var/log/apache.log | teller redact\\n```\\n\\nFinally, if you\\'ve got some files you want to redact, you can do that too:\\n\\n```\\n$ teller redact --in dirty.csv --out clean.csv\\n```\\n\\nIf you omit `--in` Teller will take `stdin`, and if you omit `--out` Teller will output to `stdout`.\\n\\n## :beetle: Detect secrets and value drift\\n\\nYou can detect _secret drift_ by comparing values from different providers against each other. It might be that you want to pin a set of keys in different providers to always be the same value; when they aren\\'t -- that means you have a drift.\\n\\nIn most cases, keys in providers would be similar which we call _mirrored_ providers. Example:\\n\\n```\\nProvider1:\\n  MG_PASS=foo***\\n\\nProvider2:\\n  MG_PASS=foo***   # Both keys are called MG_PASS\\n```\\n\\nTo detected mirror drifts, we use `teller mirror-drift`.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ teller mirror-drift --source global-dotenv --target my-dotenv\\n\\nDrifts detected: 2\\n\\nchanged [] global-dotenv FOO_BAR \"n***** != my-dotenv FOO_BAR ne*****\\nmissing [] global-dotenv FB 3***** ??\\n```\\n\\nUse `mirror-drift --sync ...` in order to declare that the two providers should represent a completely synchronized mirror (all keys, all values).\\n\\nAs always, the specific provider definitions are in your `teller.yml` file.\\n\\n## :beetle: Detect secrets and value drift (graph links between providers)\\n\\nSome times you want to check drift between two providers, and two unrelated keys. For example:\\n\\n```\\nProvider1:\\n  MG_PASS=foo***\\n\\nProvider2:\\n  MAILGUN_PASS=foo***\\n```\\n\\nThis poses a challenge. We need some way to \"wire\" the keys `MG_PASS` and `MAILGUN_PASS` and declare a relationship of source (`MG_PASS`) and destination, or sink (`MAILGUN_PASS`).\\n\\nFor this, you can label mappings as `source` and couple with the appropriate sink as `sink`, effectively creating a graph of wirings. We call this `graph-drift` (use same label value for both to wire them together). Then, source values will be compared against sink values in your configuration:\\n\\n```yaml\\nproviders:\\n  dotenv:\\n    env_sync:\\n      path: ~/my-dot-env.env\\n      source: s1\\n  dotenv2:\\n    kind: dotenv\\n    env_sync:\\n      path: ~/other-dot-env.env\\n      sink: s1\\n```\\n\\nAnd run\\n\\n```\\n$ teller graph-drift dotenv dotenv2 -c your-config.yml\\n```\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83390/117453797-07512380-af4e-11eb-949e-cc875e854fad.png)\\n\\n## :scroll: Populate templates\\n\\nHave a kickstarter project you want to populate quickly with some variables (not secrets though!)?\\n\\nHave a production project that just _has_ to have a file to read that contains your variables?\\n\\nYou can use `teller` to inject variables into your own templates (based on [go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)).\\n\\nWith this template:\\n\\n```go\\nHello, {{.Teller.EnvByKey \"FOO_BAR\" \"default-value\" }}!\\n```\\n\\nRun:\\n\\n```\\n$ teller template my-template.tmpl out.txt\\n```\\n\\nWill get you, assuming `FOO_BAR=Spock`:\\n\\n```\\nHello, Spock!\\n```\\n\\n## :arrows_counterclockwise: Copy/sync data between providers\\n\\nIn cases where you want to sync between providers, you can do that with `teller copy`.\\n\\n**Specific mapping key sync**\\n\\n```bash\\n$ teller copy --from dotenv1 --to dotenv2,heroku1\\n```\\n\\nThis will:\\n\\n1. Grab all mapped values from source (`dotenv1`)\\n2. For each target provider, find the matching mapped key, and copy the value from source into it\\n\\n**Full copy sync**\\n\\n```bash\\n$ teller copy --sync --from dotenv1 --to dotenv2,heroku1\\n```\\n\\nThis will:\\n\\n1. Grab all mapped values from source (`dotenv1`)\\n2. For each target provider, perform a full copy of values from source into the mapped `env_sync` key\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n- The mapping per provider is as configured in your `teller.yaml` file, in the `env_sync` or `env` properties.\\n- This sync will try to copy _all_ values from the source.\\n\\n## :bike: Write and multi-write to providers\\n\\nTeller providers supporting _write_ use cases which allow writing values _into_ providers.\\n\\nRemember, for this feature it still revolves around definitions in your `teller.yml` file:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ teller put FOO_BAR=$MY_NEW_PASS --providers dotenv -c .teller.write.yml\\n```\\n\\nA few notes:\\n\\n- Values are key-value pair in the format: `key=value` and you can specify multiple pairs at once\\n- When you\\'re specifying a literal sensitive value, make sure to use an ENV variable so that nothing sensitive is recorded in your history\\n- The flag `--providers` lets you push to one or more providers at once\\n- `FOO_BAR` must be a mapped key in your configuration for each provider you want to update\\n\\nSometimes you don\\'t have a mapped key in your configuration file and want to perform an ad-hoc write, you can do that with `--path`:\\n\\n```\\n$ teller put SMTP_PASS=newpass --path secret/data/foo --providers hashicorp_vault\\n```\\n\\nA few notes:\\n\\n- The pair `SMTP_PASS=newpass` will be pushed to the specified path\\n- While you can push to multiple providers, please make sure the _path semantics_ are the same\\n\\n## :x: Delete and multi-delete from providers\\n\\nTeller providers support _deleting_ values _from_ providers.\\n\\nThis feature revolves around definitions in your `teller.yml` file:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ teller delete FOO_BAR --providers dotenv -c .teller.yml\\n```\\n\\nA few notes:\\n\\n- You can specify multiple keys to delete, for example:\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ teller delete FOO BAR BAZ --providers dotenv\\n  ```\\n\\n- The flag `--providers` lets you push to one or more providers at once\\n- All keys must be a mapped key in your configuration for each provider you want to delete from\\n\\nSometimes you don\\'t have a mapped key in your configuration file and want to perform an ad-hoc delete. You can do that with the `--path` flag:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ teller delete FOO BAR --path ~/my-env-file.env --providers dotenv\\n```\\n\\nYou can also delete all keys at once for a given path, without specifying them one by one:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ teller delete --all-keys --path ~/my-env-file.env --providers dotenv\\n```\\n\\n## :white_check_mark: Prompts and options\\n\\nThere are a few options that you can use:\\n\\n- **carry_env** - carry the environment from the parent process into the child process. By default we isolate the child process from the parent process. (default: _false_)\\n\\n- **confirm** - an interactive question to prompt the user before taking action (such as running a process). (default: _empty_)\\n\\n- **opts** - a dict for our own variable/setting substitution mechanism. For example:\\n\\n```\\nopts:\\n  region: env:AWS_REGION\\n  stage: qa\\n```\\n\\nAnd now you can use paths like `/{{stage}}/{{region}}/billing-svc` where ever you want (this templating is available for the **confirm** question too).\\n\\nIf you prefix a value with `env:` it will get pulled from your current environment.\\n\\n## `YAML` Export in YAML format\\n\\nYou can export in a YAML format, suitable for [GCloud](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/env-var):\\n\\n```\\n$ teller yaml\\n```\\n\\nExample format:\\n\\n```yaml\\nFOO: \"1\"\\nKEY: VALUE\\n```\\n\\n## `JSON` Export in JSON format\\n\\nYou can export in a JSON format, suitable for piping through `jq` or other workflows:\\n\\n```\\n$ teller json\\n```\\n\\nExample format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"FOO\": \"1\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# Providers\\n\\nFor each provider, there are a few points to understand:\\n\\n- Sync - full sync support. Can we provide a path to a whole environment and have it synced (all keys, all values). Some of the providers support this and some don\\'t.\\n- Key format - some of the providers expect a path-like key, some env-var like, and some don\\'t care. We\\'ll specify for each.\\n\\n## General provider configuration\\n\\nWe use the following general structure to specify sync mapping for all providers:\\n\\n```yaml\\n# you can use either `env_sync` or `env` or both\\nenv_sync:\\n  path: ... # path to mapping\\n  remap:\\n    PROVIDER_VAR1: VAR3 # Maps PROVIDER_VAR1 to local env var VAR3\\nenv:\\n  VAR1:\\n    path: ... # path to value or mapping\\n    field: <key> # optional: use if path contains a k/v dict\\n    decrypt: true | false # optional: use if provider supports encryption at the value side\\n    severity: high | medium | low | none # optional: used for secret scanning, default is high. \\'none\\' means not a secret\\n    redact_with: \"**XXX**\" # optional: used as a placeholder swapping the secret with it. default is \"**REDACTED**\"\\n  VAR2:\\n    path: ...\\n```\\n\\n### Remapping Provider Variables\\n\\nProviders which support syncing a list of keys and values can be remapped to different environment variable keys. Typically, when teller syncs paths from `env_sync`, the key returned from the provider is directly mapped to the environment variable key. In some cases it might be necessary to have the provider key mapped to a different variable without changing the provider settings. This can be useful when using `env_sync` for [Hashicorp Vault Dynamic Database credentials](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/databases):\\n\\n```yaml\\nenv_sync:\\n  path: database/roles/my-role\\n  remap:\\n    username: PGUSER\\n    password: PGPASSWORD\\n```\\n\\nAdditionally, you can remap key settings by using `remap_with` instead of `remap`:\\n```yaml\\nenv_sync:\\n  path: database/roles/my-role\\n  remap_with: # Use either remap or remap_with, not both.\\n    username:\\n      field: PGUSER\\n      severity: none\\n    password:\\n      field: PGPASSWORD\\n      severity: high\\n      redact_with: \"**XXX**\"\\n```\\n\\nAfter remapping, the local environment variable `PGUSER` will contain the provider value for `username` and `PGPASSWORD` will contain the provider value for `password`.\\n\\n## Hashicorp Vault\\n\\n### Authentication\\n\\nIf you have the Vault CLI configured and working, there\\'s no special action to take.\\n\\nConfiguration is environment based, as defined by client standard.

For get credentials via [az client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) add `AZURE_CLI=1` to your environment variable\\n\\nThen set your vault-name by specific as environment variable: `KVAULT_NAME`\\n\\n### Features\\n\\n- Sync - `yes`\\n- Mapping - `yes`\\n- Modes - `read+write+delete`\\n\\n### Example Config\\n\\n```yaml\\nproviders:\\n  azure_keyvault:\\n    env_sync:\\n      path: azure\\n    env:\\n      FOO:\\n        path: bar\\n```\\n\\n# Semantics\\n\\n## Addressing\\n\\n- Stores that support key-value interfaces: `path` is the direct location of the value, no need for the `env` key or `field`.\\n- Stores that support key-valuemap interfaces: `path` is the location of the map, while the `env` key or `field` (if exists) will be used to do the additional final addressing.\\n- For env-sync (fetching value map out of a store), path will be a direct pointer at the key-valuemap\\n\\n## Errors\\n\\n- **Principle of non-recovery**: where possible an error is return when it is not recoverable (nothing to do), but when it is -- providers should attempt recovery (e.g. retry API call)\\n- **Missing key/value**: it\\'s possible that when trying to fetch value in a provider - it\\'s missing. This is not an error, rather an indication of a missing entry is returned (`EnvEntry#IsFound`)\\n\\n# Security Model\\n\\n## Project Practices\\n\\n- We `vendor` our dependencies and push them to the repo. This creates an immutable, independent build, that\\'s also free from risks of fetching unknown code in CI/release time.\\n\\n## Providers\\n\\nFor every provider, we are federating all authentication and authorization concern to the system of origin. In other words, if for example you connect to your organization\\'s Hashicorp Vault, we assume you already have a secure way to do that, which is \"blessed\" by the organization.\\n\\nIn addition, we don\\'t offer any way to specify connection details to these systems in writing (in configuration files or other), and all connection details, to all providers, should be supplied via environment variables.\\n\\nThat allows us to keep two important points:\\n\\n1. Don\\'t undermine the user\\'s security model and threat modeling for the sake of productivity (security AND productivity CAN be attained)\\n2. Don\\'t encourage the user to do what we\\'re here for -- save secrets and sensitive details from being forgotten in various places.\\n\\n## Developer Guide\\n\\n- [Add new provider](./doc/new-provider.md)\\n- Quick testing as you code: `make lint && make test`\\n- Checking your work before PR, run also integration tests: `make integration`\\n\\n### Testing\\n\\nTesting is composed of _unit tests_ and _integration tests_.

There are more and more kubernetes native storage systems nowadays and stateful applications are shifting into cloud native world, for example, modern databases and middlewares. However, both modern databases and its storage providers try to solve some common problems in their own way. For example, they both deal with data replications and consistency. This introduces a giant waste of both capacity and performance and needs more mantainness effort. And besides that, stateful applications strive to be more peformant, eliminating every possible latency, which is unavoidable for modern distributed storage systems. Enters carina.\\n\\nCarina is a standard kubernetes CSI plugin. Users can use standard kubernetes storage resources like storageclass/PVC/PV to request storage media. The key considerations of carina includes:\\n\\n* Workloads need different storage systems. Carina will focus on cloudnative database scenario usage only.\\n* Completely kubernetes native and easy to install.\\n* Using local disks and group them as needed, user can provison different type of disks using different storage class.\\n* Scaning physical disks and building a RAID as required. If disk fails, just plugin a new one and it\\'s done.\\n* Node capacity and performance aware, so scheduling pods more smartly.\\n* Extremly low overhead. Carina sit besides the core data path and provide raw disk performance to applications.\\n* Auto tiering. Admins can configure carina to combine the large-capacity-but-low-performant disk and small-capacity-but-high-performant disks as one storageclass, so user can benifit both from capacity and performance.\\n* If nodes fails, carina will automatically detach the local volume from pods thus pods can be rescheduled.\\n* Middleware runs on baremetals for decades. There are many valueable optimizations and enhancements which are definitely not outdated  even in cloudnative era. Let carina be an DBA expert of the storage domain for cloudnative databases!\\n\\n\\n**In short, Carina strives to provide extremely-low-latency and noOps storage system for cloudnative databases and be DBA expert of the storage domain in cloudnative era!**\\n\\n# Running Environments\\n\\n* Kubernetes：(CSI_VERSION=1.5.0)\\n* Node OS：Linux\\n* Filesystems：ext4，xfs\\n\\n* If Kubelet is running in containerized mode, you need to mount the host /dev:/dev directory\\n* Each node in the cluster has 1..N Bare disks, supporting SSDS and HDDS. (You can run the LSBLK --output NAME,ROTA command to view the disk type. If ROTA=1 is HDD,ROTA =0 is SSD.)\\n* The capacity of a raw disk must be greater than 10 GB\\n* If the server does not support the bcache kernel module, see [FAQ](docs/manual/FAQ.md), Modify yamL deployment\\n\\n### Kubernetes compatiblity\\n| kubernetes | v0.9       | v0.9.1     | v0.10      | v0.11.0      | v1.0        |\\n| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |\\n| >=1.18     | support    | support    | support    | support      | not released |\\n| >=1.25     | nonsupport | nonsupport | nonsupport | experimental | not released |\\n\\n# Carina architecture\\n\\nCarina is built for cloudnative stateful applications with raw disk performance and ops-free maintainess. Carina can scan local disks and classify them by disk types， for example, one node can have 10 HDDs and 2 SSDs. Carina then will group them into different disk pools and user can request different disk type by using different storage class. For data HA, carina now leverages STORCLI to build RAID groups.\\n\\n![carina-arch](docs/img/architecture.png)\\n\\n# Carina components\\n\\nIt has three componets: carina-scheduler, carina-controller and carina-node.\\n\\n* carina-scheduler is an kubernetes scheduler plugin, sorting nodes based on the requested PV size、node\\'s free disk space and node IO perf stats. By default, carina-scheduler supports binpack and spreadout policies.\\n* carina-controller is the controll plane of carina, which watches PVC resources and maintain the internal logivalVolume object.\\n* carina-node is an agent which runs on each node. It manage local disks using LVM.\\n\\n# Features\\n\\n* [disk management](docs/manual/disk-manager.md)\\n* [device registration](docs/manual/device-register.md)\\n* [volume mode: filesystem](docs/manual/pvc-xfs.md)\\n* [volume mode: block](docs/manual/pvc-device.md)\\n* [PVC resizing](docs/manual/pvc-expand.md)\\n* [scheduing based on capacity](docs/manual/capacity-scheduler.md)\\n* [volume tooplogy](docs/manual/topology.md)\\n* [PVC autotiering](docs/manual/pvc-bcache.md)\\n* [RAID management](docs/manual/raid-manager.md)\\n* [failover](docs/manual/failover.md)\\n* [io throttling](docs/manual/disk-speed-limit.md)\\n* [metrics](docs/manual/metrics.md)\\n* [API](docs/manual/api.md)\\n\\n# Quickstart\\n\\n## Install by shell\\n\\n- In this deployment mode, the image TAG is Latest.

It is implemented by mirroring the entire device over the network,\\nwhich can be thought of as a kind of network RAID. This installer can directly install DRBD to a\\ncontainer cluster. Currently this module is only for testing purposes.\\n[Learn more](docs/docs/architecture/modules/drbd.md)\\n\\n### Exporter\\n\\nExporter will collect the system metrics including nodes, storage pools, volumes, disks. It supports Prometheus.\\n\\n### Volume Snapshot\\n\\nHwameiStor provides the feature of snapshot and the restore on the LVM volumes.\\nCurrently, the snapshot/restore feature works for LVM non-HA volume.\\n\\n### Volume Auto Resize\\n\\nHwameiStor can automatically expand the LVM volume according the pre-defined resize policy.\\nUser can define the preferred policy and describe how and when to expand the volume, and HwameiStor will take the policy into effect.\\n\\n### Volume IO Throtting\\n\\nHwameiStor can set a maxmium rate (e.g. bandwidth, IOPS) to access a volume.\\nThis feature is very important to prevent the Pod from crashing, especially in the low-resource condition. \\n\\n### App Failover\\n\\nThe feature of failover is to actively help the application to fail over to another health node with the volume replica, and continue the working.\\n\\n### Audit\\n\\nHwameiStor provides the information about the resource history, including cluster, node, storage pool,

K8up takes care of the rest. It also provides a Prometheus endpoint for monitoring.\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nThe documentation is written in AsciiDoc and published with Antora to [k8up.io](https://k8up.io/).\\nIt\\'s source is available in the `docs/` directory.\\n\\nRun `make docs-preview` to build the docs and preview changes.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nK8up is written using [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder).\\n\\nYou\\'ll need:\\n\\n- A running Kubernetes cluster (minishift, minikube, k3s, ... you name it)\\n- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)\\n- Go development environment\\n- Your favorite IDE (with a Go plugin)\\n- Docker\\n- `make`\\n- `sed` (or `gsed` for MacOS)\\n\\nTo run the end-to-end test (e.g. `make e2e-test`), you additionally need:\\n\\n- `helm` (version 3)\\n- `jq`\\n- `yq`\\n- `node` and `npm`\\n- `bash` (installed, doesn\\'t have to be your default shell)\\n- `base64`\\n- `find`\\n\\nThese are the most common make targets: `build`, `test`, `docker-build`, `run`, `kind-run`.\\nRun `make help` to get an overview over the relevant targets and their intentions.\\n\\nYou can find the project roadmap at [k8up.io](https://k8up.io/k8up/about/roadmap.html).\\n\\nWe use [Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/k8up-io/k8up) to test the code regularly for vulnerabilities and other security issues.\\n\\nIf you find any security issue, please follow our [Vulnerability Reporting](https://k8up.io/k8up/about/vulnerability_reporting.html) process.\\n\\n### Code Structure\\n\\nK8s consists of two main modules:\\n\\n- The _operator_ module is the part that runs constantly within K8s and contains the various reconciliation loops.\\n- The _restic_ module is our interface to the `restic` binary and is invoked whenever a `Backup` or `Restore` (or similar) custom resource is instantiated.\\n  If it\\'s job (like doing a backup or a restore) is done, the process ends.\\n\\n```asciidoc\\n/\\n- api           Go Types for the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) [o]\\n- cmd           CLI definition and entrypoints\\n- common        Code that is not specific to either\\n- config        Various configuration files for the Operator SDK [o]\\n- controllers   The reconciliation loops of the operator module [o]\\n- docs          Out ASCIIdoc code as published on https://k8up.io\\n- e2e           The Bats-based End-To-End tests\\n- envtest       Infrastructure code for the integration tests\\n- operator      Code that is otherwise related to the _operator module_,\\n                but not part of the recommended Operator SDK structure.\\n- restic        Code that makes up the _restic module_.\\n\\n[o]: this is part of the recommended Operator SDK structure\\n```\\n\\n### Generate Kubernetes code\\n\\nIf you make changes to the CRD structs you\\'ll need to run code generation.\\nThis can be done with make:\\n\\n```bash\\nmake generate\\n```\\n\\n### Install CRDs\\n\\nCRDs can be either installed on the cluster by running `make install` or using `kubectl apply -f config/crd/apiextensions.k8s.io/v1`.\\n\\nCurrently there\\'s an issue using [`make install`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/issues/1544) related to how the CRDs are specified.\\nTherefore settle to the second approach for now.\\n\\n### Run the operator\\n\\nYou can run the operator in different ways:\\n\\n1. as a container image (see [quickstart](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/quickstart/))\\n2. using `make run-operator` (provide your own kubeconfig)\\n3. using `make kind-run` (uses KIND to install a cluster in docker and provides its own kubeconfig in `testbin/`)\\n4. using a configuration of your favorite IDE\\n\\nBest is if you have [minio](https://min.io/download) installed somewhere to be able to setup the needed env values. It needs to be reachable from within your dev cluster.\\n\\n### Run E2E tests\\n\\nYou need `node` and `npm` to run the tests, as it runs with [DETIK][detik].\\n\\nTo run e2e tests, execute:\\n\\n```bash\\nmake e2e-test\\n```\\n\\nTo test just a specific e2e test, run:\\n\\n```bash\\nmake e2e-test -e BATS_FILES=test-02-deployment.bats\\n```\\n\\nTo remove the local KIND cluster and other e2e resources, run:\\n\\n```bash\\nmake e2e-clean\\n```\\n\\nTo cleanup all created artifacts, there\\'s always:\\n\\n```bash\\nmake clean\\n```\\n\\n### Example configurations\\n\\nThere are a number of example configurations in [`config/samples`](config/samples).\\nApply them using `kubectl apply -f config/samples/somesample.yaml`\\n\\n### Code of Conduct\\n\\nOur code of conduct can be read at [k8up.io](https://k8up.io/k8up/about/code_of_conduct.html).\\n\\n[build]: https://github.com/k8up-io/k8up/actions?query=workflow%3ATest\\n[releases]: https://github.com/k8up-io/k8up/releases\\n[license]: https://github.com/k8up-io/k8up/blob/master/LICENSE\\n[detik]: https://github.com/bats-core/bats-detik\\n',\n",

Longhorn is cloud-native storage built using Kubernetes and container primitives.\\n\\nLonghorn is lightweight, reliable, and powerful. You can install Longhorn on an existing Kubernetes cluster with one `kubectl apply`command or by using Helm charts. Once Longhorn is installed, it adds persistent volume support to the Kubernetes cluster.\\n\\nLonghorn implements distributed block storage using containers and microservices. Longhorn creates a dedicated storage controller for each block device volume and synchronously replicates the volume across multiple replicas stored on multiple nodes. The storage controller and replicas are themselves orchestrated using Kubernetes. Here are some notable features of Longhorn:\\n\\n1. Enterprise-grade distributed storage with no single point of failure\\n2. Incremental snapshot of block storage\\n3. Backup to secondary storage (NFSv4 or S3-compatible object storage) built on efficient change block detection\\n4. Recurring snapshot and backup\\n5. Automated non-disruptive upgrade. You can upgrade the entire Longhorn software stack without disrupting running volumes!\\n6. Intuitive GUI dashboard\\n\\nYou can read more technical details of Longhorn [here](https://longhorn.io/).\\n\\n# Releases\\n\\n> **NOTE**:\\n> - __\\\\<version\\\\>*__ means the release branch is under active support and will have periodic follow-up patch releases.\\n> - __Latest__ release means the version is the latest release of the newest release branch.\\n> - __Stable__ release means the version is stable and has been widely adopted by users.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/releases\\n\\n| Release   | Version | Type           | Release Note (Changelog)                                       | Important Note                                              |\\n|-----------|---------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| **1.5***  | 1.5.1   | Latest         | [🔗](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/releases/tag/v1.5.1) | [🔗](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.5.0/deploy/important-notes) |\\n| **1.4***  | 1.4.3   | Stable         | [🔗](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/releases/tag/v1.4.2) | [🔗](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.4.3/deploy/important-notes) |\\n| **1.3***  | 1.3.3   | Stable         | [🔗](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/releases/tag/v1.3.3) | [🔗](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.3.3/deploy/important-notes) |\\n| 1.2       | 1.2.6   | Stable         | [🔗](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/releases/tag/v1.2.6) | [🔗](https://longhorn.io/docs/1.2.6/deploy/important-notes) |\\n| 1.1       | 1.1.3   | Stable         | [🔗](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/releases/tag/v1.1.3) |                                                             |\\n\\n# Roadmap\\n\\nhttps://github.com/longhorn/longhorn/wiki/Roadmap\\n\\n# Components\\n\\nLonghorn is 100% open source software.

OpenEBS is itself deployed as a set of containers on Kubernetes worker nodes. Uses Kubernetes itself to orchestrate and manage OpenEBS components.\\n- Built completely in userspace making it highly portable to run across any OS/platform.\\n- Completely intent-driven, inheriting the same principles that drive the ease of use with Kubernetes.\\n- OpenEBS supports a range of storage engines so that developers can deploy the storage technology appropriate to their application design objectives. Distributed applications like Cassandra can use the LocalPV engine for lowest latency writes. Monolithic applications like MySQL and PostgreSQL can use the ZFS engine (cStor) for resilience. Streaming applications like Kafka can use the NVMe engine [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/Mayastor) for best performance in edge environments. Across engine types, OpenEBS provides a consistent framework for high availability, snapshots, clones and manageability.\\n\\nOpenEBS itself is deployed as just another container on your host and enables storage services that can be designated on a per pod, application, cluster or container level, including:\\n- Automate the management of storage attached to the Kubernetes worker nodes and allow the storage to be used for Dynamically provisioning OpenEBS Replicated or Local PVs.\\n- Data persistence across nodes, dramatically reducing time spent rebuilding Cassandra rings for example.\\n- Synchronous replication of volume data across availability zones improving availability and decreasing attach/detach times for example.\\n- A common layer so whether you are running on AKS, or your bare metal, or GKE, or AWS - your wiring and developer experience for storage services is as similar as possible.\\n- Backup and Restore of volume data to and from S3 and other targets.\\n\\nAn added advantage of being a completely Kubernetes native solution is that administrators and developers can interact and manage OpenEBS using all the wonderful tooling that is available for Kubernetes like kubectl, Helm, Prometheus, Grafana, Weave Scope, etc.\\n\\n**Our vision** is simple: let storage and storage services for persistent workloads be fully integrated into the environment so that each team and workload benefits from the granularity of control and Kubernetes native behaviour.\\n\\n## Scalability\\n\\nOpenEBS can scale to include an arbitrarily large number of containerized storage controllers. Kubernetes is used to provide fundamental pieces such as using etcd for inventory. OpenEBS scales to the extent your Kubernetes scales.\\n\\n## Installation and Getting Started\\n\\nOpenEBS can be set up in a few easy steps. You can get going on your choice of Kubernetes cluster by having open-iscsi installed on the Kubernetes nodes and running the openebs-operator using kubectl.\\n\\n**Start the OpenEBS Services using operator**\\n```bash\\n# apply this yaml\\nkubectl apply -f https://openebs.github.io/charts/openebs-operator.yaml\\n```\\n\\n**Start the OpenEBS Services using helm**\\n```bash\\nhelm repo update\\nhelm install --namespace openebs --name openebs stable/openebs\\n```\\n\\nYou could also follow our [QuickStart Guide](https://openebs.io/docs).\\n\\nOpenEBS can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster - either in the cloud, on-premise or developer laptop (minikube). Note that there are no changes to the underlying kernel that are required as OpenEBS operates in userspace.  Please follow our [OpenEBS Setup](https://openebs.io/docs/user-guides/quickstart) documentation.\\n\\n## Status\\n\\nOpenEBS is one of the most widely used and tested Kubernetes storage infrastructures in the industry. A CNCF Sandbox project since May 2019, OpenEBS is the first and only storage system to provide a consistent set of software-defined storage capabilities on multiple backends (local, nfs, zfs, nvme) across both on-premise and cloud systems, and was the first to open source its own Chaos Engineering Framework for Stateful Workloads, the [Litmus Project](https://litmuschaos.io), which the community relies on to automatically readiness assess the monthly cadence of OpenEBS versions. Enterprise customers have been using OpenEBS in production since 2018. \\n\\nThe status of various storage engines that power the OpenEBS Persistent Volumes are provided below. The key difference between the statuses are summarized below:\\n- **alpha:** The API may change in incompatible ways in a later software release without notice, recommended for use only in short-lived testing clusters, due to increased risk of bugs and lack of long-term support.\\n- **beta**: Support for the overall features will not be dropped, though details may change. Support for upgrading or migrating between versions will be provided, either through automation or manual steps.\\n- **stable**: Features will appear in released software for many subsequent versions and support for upgrading between versions will be provided with software automation in the vast majority of scenarios.\\n\\n\\n| Storage Engine | Status | Details |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| Jiva | stable | Best suited for running Replicated Block Storage on nodes that make use of ephemeral storage on the Kubernetes worker nodes |\\n| cStor | stable | A preferred option for running on nodes that have Block Devices. Recommended option if Snapshot and Clones are required |\\n| Local Volumes | stable | Best suited for Distributed Application that need low latency storage - direct-attached storage from the Kubernetes nodes. |\\n| Mayastor | stable | Persistent storage solution for Kubernetes, with near-native NVMe performance and advanced data services. |\\n\\nFor more details, please refer to [OpenEBS Documentation](https://openebs.io/docs/).\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nOpenEBS welcomes your feedback and contributions in any form possible.\\n\\n- [Join OpenEBS community on Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com)\\n  - Already signed up?

While other prior releases are supported, this latest release and the containerd [v1.5.11](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.11) release are recommended for Kubernetes v1.24.\\n\\nWe felt it important to announce this, particularly in view of [the dockershim removal from this release of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/05/03/dockershim-historical-context/).\\n\\nIt should be noted here that moving to CRI integrations has been in the plan for many years.  `containerd` began as part of `Docker` and was donated to `CNCF`. `containerd` remains in use today by Docker/moby/buildkit etc., and has many other [adopters](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md). `containerd` has a namespace that isolates use of `containerd` from various clients/adopters. The Kubernetes namespace is appropriately named `k8s.io`. The CRI API and `containerd` CRI plugin project has, from the start, been an effort to reduce the impact surface for Kubernetes container runtime integration. If you can\\'t tell, we are excited to see this come to fruition.\\n\\nIf you have any concerns or questions, we will be here to answer them in [issues, discussions, and/or on slack](#communication). Below you will find information/detail about our [CRI Integration](#cri) implementation.\\n\\nFor containerd users already on v1.6.0-v1.6.3, there are known issues addressed by [v1.6.4](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.4). The issues are primarily related to [CNI setup](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/dev-1.24/content/en/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/troubleshooting-cni-plugin-related-errors.md)\\n\\n### Now Recruiting\\n\\nWe are a large inclusive OSS project that is welcoming help of any kind shape or form:\\n* Documentation help is needed to make the product easier to consume and extend.\\n* We need OSS community outreach/organizing help to get the word out; manage\\nand create messaging and educational content; and help with social media, community forums/groups, and google groups.\\n* We are actively inviting new [security advisors](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#security-advisors) to join the team.\\n* New subprojects are being created, core and non-core that could use additional development help.\\n* Each of the [containerd projects](https://github.com/containerd) has a list of issues currently being worked on or that need help resolving.\\n  - If the issue has not already been assigned to someone or has not made recent progress, and you are interested, please inquire.\\n  - If you are interested in starting with a smaller/beginner-level issue, look for issues with an `exp/beginner` tag, for example [containerd/containerd beginner issues.](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aexp%2Fbeginner)\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nSee our documentation on [containerd.io](https://containerd.io):\\n* [for ops and admins](docs/ops.md)\\n* [namespaces](docs/namespaces.md)\\n* [client options](docs/client-opts.md)\\n\\nSee how to build containerd from source at [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).\\n\\nIf you are interested in trying out containerd see our example at [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md).\\n\\n## Nightly builds\\n\\nThere are nightly builds available for download [here](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/actions?query=workflow%3ANightly).\\nBinaries are generated from `main` branch every night for `Linux` and `Windows`.\\n\\nPlease be aware: nightly builds might have critical bugs, it\\'s not recommended for use in production and no support provided.\\n\\n## Kubernetes (k8s) CI Dashboard Group\\n\\nThe [k8s CI dashboard group for containerd](https://testgrid.k8s.io/containerd) contains test results regarding\\nthe health of kubernetes when run against main and a number of containerd release branches.\\n\\n- [containerd-periodics](https://testgrid.k8s.io/containerd-periodic)\\n\\n## Runtime Requirements\\n\\nRuntime requirements for containerd are very minimal. Most interactions with\\nthe Linux and Windows container feature sets are handled via [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) and/or\\nOS-specific libraries (e.g. [hcsshim](https://github.com/Microsoft/hcsshim) for Microsoft).\\nThe current required version of `runc` is described in [RUNC.md](docs/RUNC.md).\\n\\nThere are specific features\\nused by containerd core code and snapshotters that will require a minimum kernel\\nversion on Linux. With the understood caveat of distro kernel versioning, a\\nreasonable starting point for Linux is a minimum 4.x kernel version.\\n\\nThe overlay filesystem snapshotter, used by default, uses features that were\\nfinalized in the 4.x kernel series. If you choose to use btrfs, there may\\nbe more flexibility in kernel version (minimum recommended is 3.18), but will\\nrequire the btrfs kernel module and btrfs tools to be installed on your Linux\\ndistribution.\\n\\nTo use Linux checkpoint and restore features, you will need `criu` installed on\\nyour system. See more details in [Checkpoint and Restore](#checkpoint-and-restore).\\n\\nBuild requirements for developers are listed in [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).\\n\\n\\n## Supported Registries\\n\\nAny registry which is compliant with the [OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec)\\nis supported by containerd.\\n\\nFor configuring registries, see [registry host configuration documentation](docs/hosts.md)\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n### Client\\n\\ncontainerd offers a full client package to help you integrate containerd into your platform.\\n\\n```go\\n\\nimport (\\n  \"context\"\\n\\n  \"github.com/containerd/containerd\"\\n  \"github.com/containerd/containerd/cio\"\\n  \"github.com/containerd/containerd/namespaces\"\\n)\\n\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n\\tclient, err := containerd.New(\"/run/containerd/containerd.sock\")\\n\\tdefer client.Close()\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Namespaces\\n\\nNamespaces allow multiple consumers to use the same containerd without conflicting with each other.  It has the benefit of sharing content while maintaining separation with containers and images.\\n\\nTo set a namespace for requests to the API:\\n\\n```go\\ncontext = context.Background()\\n// create a context for docker\\ndocker = namespaces.WithNamespace(context, \"docker\")\\n\\ncontainerd, err := client.NewContainer(docker, \"id\")\\n```\\n\\nTo set a default namespace on the client:\\n\\n```go\\nclient, err := containerd.New(address, containerd.WithDefaultNamespace(\"docker\"))\\n```\\n\\n### Distribution\\n\\n```go\\n// pull an image\\nimage, err := client.Pull(context, \"docker.io/library/redis:latest\")\\n\\n// push an image\\nerr := client.Push(context, \"docker.io/library/redis:latest\", image.Target())\\n```\\n\\n### Containers\\n\\nIn containerd, a container is a metadata object. Resources such as an OCI runtime specification, image, root filesystem, and other metadata can be attached to a container.\\n\\n```go\\nredis, err := client.NewContainer(context, \"redis-master\")\\ndefer redis.Delete(context)\\n```\\n\\n### OCI Runtime Specification\\n\\ncontainerd fully supports the OCI runtime specification for running containers.  We have built-in functions to help you generate runtime specifications based on images as well as custom parameters.\\n\\nYou can specify options when creating a container about how to modify the specification.\\n\\n```go\\nredis, err := client.NewContainer(context, \"redis-master\", containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)))\\n```\\n\\n### Root Filesystems\\n\\ncontainerd allows you to use overlay or snapshot filesystems with your containers.  It comes with built-in support for overlayfs and btrfs.\\n\\n```go\\n// pull an image and unpack it into the configured snapshotter\\nimage, err := client.Pull(context, \"docker.io/library/redis:latest\", containerd.WithPullUnpack)\\n\\n// allocate a new RW root filesystem for a container based on the image\\nredis, err := client.NewContainer(context, \"redis-master\",\\n\\tcontainerd.WithNewSnapshot(\"redis-rootfs\", image),\\n\\tcontainerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)),\\n)\\n\\n// use a readonly filesystem with multiple containers\\nfor i := 0; i < 10; i++ {\\n\\tid := fmt.Sprintf(\"id-%s\", i)\\n\\tcontainer, err := client.NewContainer(ctx, id,\\n\\t\\tcontainerd.WithNewSnapshotView(id, image),\\n\\t\\tcontainerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)),\\n\\t)\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Tasks\\n\\nTaking a container object and turning it into a runnable process on a system is done by creating a new `Task` from the container.  A task represents the runnable object within containerd.\\n\\n```go\\n// create a new task\\ntask, err := redis.NewTask(context, cio.NewCreator(cio.WithStdio))\\ndefer task.Delete(context)\\n\\n// the task is now running and has a pid that can be used to setup networking\\n// or other runtime settings outside of containerd\\npid := task.Pid()\\n\\n// start the redis-server process inside the container\\nerr := task.Start(context)\\n\\n// wait for the task to exit and get the exit status\\nstatus, err := task.Wait(context)\\n```\\n\\n### Checkpoint and Restore\\n\\nIf you have [criu](https://criu.org/Main_Page) installed on your machine you can checkpoint and restore containers and their tasks.  This allows you to clone and/or live migrate containers to other machines.\\n\\n```go\\n// checkpoint the task then push it to a registry\\ncheckpoint, err := task.Checkpoint(context)\\n\\nerr := client.Push(context, \"myregistry/checkpoints/redis:master\", checkpoint)\\n\\n// on a new machine pull the checkpoint and restore the redis container\\ncheckpoint, err := client.Pull(context, \"myregistry/checkpoints/redis:master\")\\n\\nredis, err = client.NewContainer(context, \"redis-master\", containerd.WithNewSnapshot(\"redis-rootfs\", checkpoint))\\ndefer container.Delete(context)\\n\\ntask, err = redis.NewTask(context, cio.NewCreator(cio.WithStdio), containerd.WithTaskCheckpoint(checkpoint))\\ndefer task.Delete(context)\\n\\nerr := task.Start(context)\\n```\\n\\n### Snapshot Plugins\\n\\nIn addition to the built-in Snapshot plugins in containerd, additional external\\nplugins can be configured using GRPC. An external plugin is made available using\\nthe configured name and appears as a plugin alongside the built-in ones.\\n\\nTo add an external snapshot plugin, add the plugin to containerd\\'s config file\\n(by default at `/etc/containerd/config.toml`). The string following\\n`proxy_plugin.` will be used as the name of the snapshotter and the address\\nshould refer to a socket with a GRPC listener serving containerd\\'s Snapshot\\nGRPC API. Remember to restart containerd for any configuration changes to take\\neffect.\\n\\n```\\n[proxy_plugins]\\n  [proxy_plugins.customsnapshot]\\n    type = \"snapshot\"\\n    address =  \"/var/run/mysnapshotter.sock\"\\n```\\n\\nSee [PLUGINS.md](/docs/PLUGINS.md) for how to create plugins\\n\\n### Releases and API Stability\\n\\nPlease see [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md) for details on versioning and stability\\nof containerd components.\\n\\nDownloadable 64-bit Intel/AMD binaries of all official releases are available on\\nour [releases page](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases).\\n\\nFor other architectures and distribution support, you will find that many\\nLinux distributions package their own containerd and provide it across several\\narchitectures, such as [Canonical\\'s Ubuntu packaging](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/bionic/+package/containerd).\\n\\n#### Enabling command auto-completion\\n\\nStarting with containerd 1.4, the urfave client feature for auto-creation of bash and zsh\\nautocompletion data is enabled. To use the autocomplete feature in a bash shell for example, source\\nthe autocomplete/ctr file in your `.bashrc`, or manually like:\\n\\n```\\n$ source ./contrib/autocomplete/ctr\\n```\\n\\n#### Distribution of `ctr` autocomplete for bash and zsh\\n\\nFor bash, copy the `contrib/autocomplete/ctr` script into\\n`/etc/bash_completion.d/` and rename it to `ctr`.

With it, you are able to use containerd as the container runtime for a Kubernetes cluster.\\n\\n![cri](./docs/cri/cri.png)\\n\\n#### CRI Status\\n\\n`cri` is a native plugin of containerd. Since containerd 1.1, the cri plugin is built into the release binaries and enabled by default.\\n\\n> **Note:** As of containerd 1.5, the `cri` plugin is merged into the containerd/containerd repo. For example, the source code previously stored under [`containerd/cri/pkg`](https://github.com/containerd/cri/tree/release/1.4/pkg)\\nwas moved to [`containerd/containerd/pkg/cri` package](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/main/pkg/cri).\\n\\nThe `cri` plugin has reached GA status, representing that it is:\\n* Feature complete\\n* Works with Kubernetes 1.10 and above\\n* Passes all [CRI validation tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/cri-validation.md).\\n* Passes all [node e2e tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/e2e-node-tests.md).\\n* Passes all [e2e tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-testing/e2e-tests.md).\\n\\nSee results on the containerd k8s [test dashboard](https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/sig-node-containerd)\\n\\n#### Validating Your `cri` Setup\\nA Kubernetes incubator project, [cri-tools](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools), includes programs for exercising CRI implementations. More importantly, cri-tools includes the program `critest` which is used for running [CRI Validation Testing](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/cri-validation.md).\\n\\n#### CRI Guides\\n* [Installing with Ansible and Kubeadm](contrib/ansible/README.md)\\n* [For Non-Ansible Users, Preforming a Custom Installation Using the Release Tarball and Kubeadm](docs/getting-started.md)\\n* [CRI Plugin Testing Guide](./docs/cri/testing.md)\\n* [Debugging Pods, Containers, and Images with `crictl`](./docs/cri/crictl.md)\\n* [Configuring `cri` Plugins](./docs/cri/config.md)\\n* [Configuring containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/man/containerd-config.8.md)\\n\\n### Communication\\n\\nFor async communication and long-running discussions please use issues and pull requests on the GitHub repo.\\nThis will be the best place to discuss design and implementation.\\n\\nFor sync communication catch us in the `#containerd` and `#containerd-dev` Slack channels on Cloud Native Computing Foundation\\'s (CNCF) Slack - `cloud-native.slack.com`.

Did you find\\nsomething interesting on the web about the project? Awesome, feel free to open\\nup a PR and add it to the list.\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\n### Installing CRI-O\\n\\nTo install `CRI-O`, you can follow our [installation guide](install.md).\\nAlternatively, if you\\'d rather build `CRI-O` from source, checkout our [setup\\nguide](install.md#build-and-install-cri-o-from-source).\\nWe also provide a way in building\\n[static binaries of `CRI-O`](install.md#static-builds) via nix.\\nThose binaries are available for every successfully built commit on our\\n[Google Cloud Storage Bucket][bucket].\\nThis means that the latest commit can be installed via our convenience script:\\n\\n[bucket]: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/cri-o/artifacts\\n\\n```console\\n> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cri-o/cri-o/main/scripts/get | bash\\n```\\n\\nThe script automatically verifies the uploaded sigstore signatures as well, if\\nthe local system has [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) available in\\nits `$PATH`. The same applies to the [SPDX](https://spdx.org) based bill of\\nmaterials (SBOM), which gets automatically verified if the\\n[bom](https://sigs.k8s.io/bom) tool is in `$PATH`.\\n\\nBesides `amd64`, we also support the `arm64` and `ppc64le` bit architectures.\\nThis can be selected via the script, too:\\n\\n<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->\\n```shell\\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cri-o/cri-o/main/scripts/get | bash -s -- -a arm64\\n```\\n\\nIt is also possible to select a specific git SHA or tag by:\\n\\n```shell\\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cri-o/cri-o/main/scripts/get | bash -s -- -t v1.21.0\\n```\\n<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->\\n\\nThe above script resolves to the download URL of the static binary bundle\\ntarball matching the format:\\n\\n```text\\nhttps://storage.googleapis.com/cri-o/artifacts/cri-o.$ARCH.$REV.tar.gz\\n```\\n\\nWhere `$ARCH` can be `amd64` or `arm64` or `ppc64le` and `$REV`\\ncan be any git SHA or tag.\\nPlease be aware that using the latest `main` SHA might cause a race, because\\nthe CI has not finished publishing the artifacts yet or failed.\\n\\nWe also provide a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in the [SPDX\\nformat](https://spdx.org) for each bundle. The SBOM is available at the same URL\\nlike the bundle itself, but suffixed with `.spdx`:\\n\\n```text\\nhttps://storage.googleapis.com/cri-o/artifacts/cri-o.$ARCH.$REV.tar.gz.spdx\\n```\\n\\n### Running Kubernetes with CRI-O\\n\\nBefore you begin, you\\'ll need to [start CRI-O](install.md#starting-cri-o)\\n\\nYou can run a local version of Kubernetes with `CRI-O` using `local-up-cluster.sh`:\\n\\n1. Clone the [Kubernetes repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)\\n1. From the Kubernetes project directory, run:\\n\\n```console\\nCGROUP_DRIVER=systemd \\\\\\nCONTAINER_RUNTIME=remote \\\\\\nCONTAINER_RUNTIME_ENDPOINT=\\'unix:///var/run/crio/crio.sock\\' \\\\\\n./hack/local-up-cluster.sh\\n```\\n\\nFor more guidance in running `CRI-O`, visit our [tutorial page](tutorial.md)\\n\\n[podman-hooks]: https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/v3.0.1/pkg/hooks/README.md\\n[spec-hooks]: https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/v1.0.1/config.md#posix-platform-hooks\\n\\n#### The HTTP status API\\n\\nCRI-O exposes per default the [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) API to fulfill the\\nContainer Runtime Interface (CRI) of Kubernetes. Besides this, there exists an\\nadditional HTTP API to retrieve further runtime status information about CRI-O.\\nPlease be aware that this API is not considered to be stable and production\\nuse-cases should not rely on it.\\n\\nOn a running CRI-O instance, we can access the API via an HTTP transfer tool like\\n[curl](https://curl.haxx.se):\\n\\n```console\\n$ sudo curl -v --unix-socket /var/run/crio/crio.sock http://localhost/info | jq\\n{\\n  \"storage_driver\": \"btrfs\",\\n  \"storage_root\": \"/var/lib/containers/storage\",\\n  \"cgroup_driver\": \"systemd\",\\n  \"default_id_mappings\": { ... }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe following API entry points are currently supported:\\n\\n<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->\\n| Path              | Content-Type       | Description                                                                        |\\n| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\\n| `/info`           | `application/json` | General information about the runtime, like `storage_driver` and `storage_root`.   |\\n| `/containers/:id` | `application/json` | Dedicated container information, like `name`, `pid` and `image`.                   |\\n| `/config`         | `application/toml` | The complete TOML configuration (defaults to `/etc/crio/crio.conf`) used by CRI-O. |\\n| `/pause/:id`      | `application/json` | Pause a running container.                                                         |\\n| `/unpause/:id`    | `application/json` | Unpause a paused container.                                                        |\\n<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->\\n\\nThe tool `crio-status` can be used to access the API with a dedicated command\\nline tool. It supports all API endpoints via the dedicated subcommands `config`,\\n`info` and `containers`, for example:\\n\\n```console\\n$ sudo go run cmd/crio-status/main.go info\\ncgroup driver: systemd\\nstorage driver: btrfs\\nstorage root: /var/lib/containers/storage\\ndefault GID mappings (format <container>:<host>:<size>):\\n  0:0:4294967295\\ndefault UID mappings (format <container>:<host>:<size>):\\n  0:0:4294967295\\n```\\n\\n#### Metrics\\n\\nPlease refer to the [CRI-O Metrics guide](tutorials/metrics.md).\\n\\n#### Tracing\\n\\nPlease refer to the [CRI-O Tracing guide](tutorials/tracing.md).\\n\\n#### Container Runtime Interface special cases\\n\\nSome aspects of the Container Runtime are worth some additional explanation.\\nThese details are summarized in a [dedicated guide](cri.md).\\n\\n#### Debugging tips\\n\\nHaving an issue?

Inclavare Containers provides a general design for the protection of tenant’s workload. \\n  - Create the hardware-enforced isolation between tenant’s workload and privileged software controlled by CSP.\\n  - Remove CSP from the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of tenant in untrusted cloud.\\n  - Construct the general attestation infrastructure to convince users to trust the workloads running inside TEE based on hardware assisted enclave technology.\\n- OCI-compliant. The component `rune` is [fully compliant](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/implementations.md#runtime-container) with OCI Runtime specification.\\n- Cloud platform agnostic. It can be deployed in any public cloud Kubernetes platform.\\n\\nPlease refer to [Terminology](docs/design/terminology.md) for more technical expressions used in Inclavare Containers.\\n\\n![cncf](docs/images/cncf.png)\\n\\nInclavare Containers is a [sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/inclavare-containers/) of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.\\n\\n# Audience\\n\\nInclavare Containers is helping to keep tenants\\' confidential data secure so they feel confident that their data is not being exposed to CSP or their own insiders, and they can easily move their trusted applications to the cloud.\\n\\n# Architecture\\n\\nInclavare Containers follows the classic container runtime design. It takes the adaption to [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd) as first class, and uses dedicated [shim-rune](https://github.com/alibaba/inclavare-containers/tree/master/shim) to interface with OCI Runtime [rune](https://github.com/alibaba/inclavare-containers/tree/master/rune). In the downstrem, [init-runelet](docs/design/terminology.md#init-runelet) employs a novel approach of launching [enclave runtime](docs/design/terminology.md#enclave-runtime) and trusted application in hardware-enforced enclave.\\n\\n![architecture](docs/design/architecture.png)\\n\\nThe major components of Inclavare Containers are:\\n\\n- rune  \\n  rune is a CLI tool for spawning and running enclaves in containers according to the OCI specification. rune is already written into [OCI Runtime implementation list](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/implementations.md#runtime-container).\\n\\n- shim-rune  \\n  shim-rune resides in between containerd and `rune`, conducting enclave signing and management beyond the normal `shim` basis. In particular shim-rune and `rune` can compose a basic enclave containerization stack for confidential computing, providing low barrier to the use of confidential computing and the same experience as ordinary container. Please refer to [this doc](shim/README.md) for the details.\\n\\n- enclave runtime  \\n  The backend of `rune` is a component called enclave runtime, which is responsible for loading and running trusted and protected applications inside enclaves. The interface between `rune` and enclave runtime is [Enclave Runtime PAL API](rune/libenclave/internal/runtime/pal/spec.md), which allows invoking enclave runtime through well-defined functions. The softwares for confidential computing may benefit from this interface to interact with cloud-native ecosystem.  \\n  \\n  One typical class of enclave runtime implementations is based on Library OSes. Currently, the recommended enclave runtime interacting with `rune` is [Occlum](https://github.com/occlum/occlum), a memory-safe, multi-process Library OS for Intel SGX.  And another typical class of enclave runtime is [WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR)](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime) with Intel SGX, a standalone WebAssembly (WASM) runtime with a small footprint, including a VM core, an application framework and a dynamic management for WASM applications.\\n  \\n  In addition, you can write your own enclave runtime with any programming language and SDK (e.g, [Intel SGX SDK](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx)) you prefer as long as it implements Enclave Runtime PAL API.\\n\\n# Attestation\\n\\nInclavare Containers implements Enclave Attestation Architecture (EAA), a universal and cross-platform remote attestation infrastructure. EAA can prove that sensitive workloads are running on a genuine and trusted hardware TEE based on confidential computing technology. The formal design of EAA will be published for RFC.\\n\\n![architecture](docs/design/eaa_demo.png)\\n\\nThe major components of EAA are:\\n\\n- [Rats-TLS](https://github.com/alibaba/inclavare-containers/tree/master/rats-tls) \\n  `Rats-TLS` enhances the standard TLS to support the trusted communications between heterogeneous hardware TEEs based on confidential computing technology, which is evolved from the [ra-tls (deprecated)](https://github.com/alibaba/inclavare-containers/tree/master/ra-tls). Even a non-hardware TEE platforms using `Rats-TLS` can communicate with a hardware TEE, e.g, SGX Enclave, through the attested and secured channel to transmit the sensitive information. In other words, the boundary of TCB is extended from execution environment to network transmission with `Rats-TLS`. In addition, `Rats-TLS` has an extensible model to support various hardware TEE. Refer to [this design doc](rats-tls/docs/design/design.md) for more details.\\n\\n- Confidential Container  \\n  Confidential container in the form of the enclave runtime `Occlum` responds to the request from `Inclavared`, and then sends back the attestation evidence of confidential container to `Inclavared`. Confidential container plays the role of the attester.\\n\\n- [Inclavared](https://github.com/alibaba/inclavare-containers/tree/master/inclavared)  \\n  `Inclavared` is responsible for forwarding the traffic between the confidential container and `Shelter`. The communication process is protected by the attested `Enclave-TLS` channel.\\n\\n- [Shelter](https://github.com/alibaba/inclavare-containers/tree/master/shelter)  \\n  `Shelter`, as the role of the verifier deployed in the off-cloud, records the launch measurements of enclave runtime, and afterward establishes the attested `Enclave-TLS` channel to communicate with `Inclavared`. Eventually, it retrieves the evidence about enclave runtimes for verification.\\n\\n# Non-core components \\n\\n- sgx-tools  \\n  sgx-tools is a CLI tool, used to interact Intel SGX AESM service to retrieve various materials such as launch token, quoting enclave\\'s target information, enclave quote and remote attestation report from IAS. Refer to [this tutorial](sgx-tools/README.md) for the details about its usage.\\n\\n- epm  \\n  epm is a service that is used to manage the cache pools to optimize the startup time of enclave. Refer to [this tutorial](epm/README.md) for the details about its usage.\\n\\n# Roadmap\\n\\nPlease refer to [Inclavare Containers Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for the details. This document outlines the development roadmap for the Inclavare Containers project.\\n\\n# Building\\n\\nIt\\'s recommended to use [Inclavare Containers development docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/inclavarecontainers/dev) to build Inclavare Containers from scratch.\\n\\nNote that the environment of launching Inclavare Containers development docker image must be capable of hardware TEE and install the corresponding software stack, e.g, Intel SGX and [Intel SGX SDK & PSW for Linux](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.14/docs/Intel_SGX_SW_Installation_Guide_for_Linux.pdf).\\n\\nThe exact command to run the docker image requires to be specified explicitly according to the type of SGX device driver.\\n\\n- For legacy out-of-tree driver:\\n\\n```shell\\ndocker run -it -v /var/run/aesmd:/var/run/aesmd \\\\\\n  -device /dev/isgx \\\\\\n  inclavarecontainers/dev:$version-$os\\n```\\n\\n- For DCAP and in-tree driver:\\n\\n```shell\\ndocker run -it -v /var/run/aesmd:/var/run/aesmd \\\\\\n  -v /dev/sgx_enclave:/dev/sgx/enclave -v /dev/sgx_provision:/dev/sgx/provision \\\\\\n  inclavarecontainers/dev:$version-$os\\n```\\n\\nwhere:\\n- `$version` denotes the version of Inclavare Containers in use.\\n- `$os` denotes the OS type of development docker image, which may be ubuntu18.04 or alinux2.\\n\\nPlease be aware of running the commands listed below in the development container launched by Inclavare Containers development docker image.\\n\\n1. Download the latest source code of Inclavare Containers\\n\\n```shell\\nmkdir -p \"$WORKSPACE\"\\ncd \"$WORKSPACE\"\\ngit clone https://github.com/alibaba/inclavare-containers\\n```\\n\\n2. Build Inclavare Containers\\n\\n```shell\\ncd inclavare-containers\\n# build rune, shim-rune, epm, sgx-tools, enclave-tls, shelter and inclavared\\nmake\\n```\\n\\n# Installing\\n\\nAfter build Inclavare Containers on your system, you can use the following command to install Inclavare Containers on your system.\\n\\n```shell\\nsudo make install\\n```\\n\\n`{rune,shim-rune,epm,sgx-tools,shelter,inclavared}` will be installed to `/usr/local/bin/{rune,containerd-shim-rune-v2,epm,sgx-tools,shelter,inclavared}` on your system. Enclave-TLS SDK will be installed to `/opt/enclave-tls`. `{enclave-tls-server,enclave-tls-client}` will be installed to `/usr/share/enclave-tls/samples`.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to build and install Inclavare Containers from latest source code. We also provide RPM/DEB repository to help you install Inclavare Containers quickly. Please see the [steps about how to configure repository](https://github.com/alibaba/inclavare-containers/blob/master/docs/create_a_confidential_computing_kubernetes_cluster_with_inclavare_containers.md#1-add-inclavare-containers-repository) firstly. Then you can run the following command to install Inclavare Containers on your system.\\n\\n- On Ubuntu 18.04 server\\n\\n```\\nsudo apt-get install rune shim-rune epm sgx-tools enclave-tls shelter inclavared\\n```\\n\\n# Integrating\\n\\nInclavare Containers can be integrated with dockerd, containerd, and [pouchd](https://github.com/alibaba/pouch).\\n\\nThe former targets using docker to deploy Inclavare Containers. Specifically, you need to install the preferred enclave runtime when building container images, and then launch the enclave runtime through `rune` and [enclave runtime specific PAL](docs/design/terminology.md#enclave-runtime-pal).\\n\\nThe latter targets using K8s to deploy Inclavare Containers. In this scenario, `shim-rune` and `rune` can compose an enclave containerization stack, so enclave runtime is not required and installed when building container images, providing with the same experience as ordinary containers.\\n\\n## dockerd\\n\\nAdd the assocated configurations for `rune` in dockerd config file, e.g, `/etc/docker/daemon.json`, on your system.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n        \"runtimes\": {\\n                \"rune\": {\\n                        \"path\": \"/usr/local/bin/rune\",\\n                        \"runtimeArgs\": []\\n                }\\n        }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nthen restart dockerd on your system.\\n\\nYou can check whether `rune` is correctly enabled or not with:\\n\\n```shell\\ndocker info | grep rune\\n```\\n\\nNote that the systemd is not installed by default, so please manually start up dockerd:\\n\\n```shell\\ndockerd -b docker0 --storage-driver=vfs &\\n```\\n\\n## containerd \\n\\nInclavare Containers is added to the [adopters list of containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md). Besides, `shim-rune` supports [containerd shim v2 API](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/runtime/v2/task/shim.proto). So you can add the assocated configurations for `shim-rune` in the `containerd` config file, e.g, `/etc/containerd/config.toml`, on your system.\\n\\n```toml\\n        [plugins.cri.containerd]\\n          ...\\n          [plugins.cri.containerd.runtimes.rune]\\n            runtime_type = \"io.containerd.rune.v2\"\\n```\\n\\nthen restart containerd on your system.\\n\\n## pouchd\\n\\nAdd the assocated configurations in pouchd config file, e.g, `/etc/pouch/config.json`, on your system.\\n\\n```json\\n\\t\"add-runtime\": {\\n\\t\\t\"rune\": {\\n            \\t\\t\"path\": \"/usr/local/bin/rune\",\\n            \\t\\t\"runtimeArgs\": null,\\n            \\t\\t\"type\": \"io.containerd.rune.v2\"\\n        \\t},\\n\\t\\t...\\n\\t}\\t\\n```\\n\\nwhere:\\n- @path: specify the path of OCI Runtime, such as the pach of `rune`.\\n- @runtimeArgs: specify the arguments of the pouchd runtime, such as `--platform`, `--network`.\\n- @type: specify the shim template from the following candidates:\\n\\t- io.containerd.rune.v2: correspond to shim-rune\\n\\t- io.containerd.runtime.v1.linux: correspond to containerd-shim\\n\\t- io.containerd.runc.v1: correspond to containerd-shim-runc-v1\\n\\nthen restart pouchd on your system.\\n\\nYou can check whether `rune` is correctly enabled or not with:\\n\\n```shell\\npouch info | grep rune\\n```\\n\\n# Deployment\\n\\nInclavare Containers can be deployed with Occlum LibOS and WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR).\\n\\n## Occlum LibOS\\n\\nPlease refer to [this guide](https://github.com/occlum/occlum/blob/master/docs/rune_quick_start.md) to run [Occlum](https://github.com/occlum/occlum) with `rune` and docker.\\n\\nPlease refer to [this guide](docs/develop_and_deploy_hello_world_application_in_kubernetes_cluster.md) to deploy an enclave container in a Kubernetes cluster. Currently, [Hello-world application image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inclavarecontainers/occlum-hello-world) and web application images based on [OpenJDK 11](https://hub.docker.com/r/inclavarecontainers/occlum-java-web), [Dragonwell](https://hub.docker.com/r/inclavarecontainers/occlum-dragonwell-web), and [Golang](https://hub.docker.com/r/inclavarecontainers/occlum-golang-web) are provided. These images don\\'t contain enclave runtime. They are only used for the deployment with containerd.\\n\\nPlease refer to [this guide](docs/running_inclavare_containers_with_pouch_and_occlum.md) to run inclavare-containers with `pouchd`.\\n\\n## WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR)\\n\\nPlease refer to [this guide](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/tree/main/product-mini/platforms/linux-sgx/enclave-sample/App#wamr-as-an-enclave-runtime-for-rune) to run [WAMR](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime) with `rune`.\\n\\n[WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR) application image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inclavarecontainers/enclave-wamr/tags) is provided. WAMR image contains enclave runtime, because it doesn\\'t adapt to shim-rune and use off-cloud signing. It is only used for the deployment with dockerd.\\n\\n\\n## License\\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Falibaba%2Finclavare-containers.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Falibaba%2Finclavare-containers?ref=badge_large)\\n',\n",

By default, it\\'ll be installed along with the lima, so, you don\\'t need to do anything extra. There will be a symlink called nerdctl pointing to nerdctl.lima. This is only created when there is no nerdctl entry in the directory already though. It worths to mention that this is created only via make install. Not included in Homebrew/MacPorts/nix packages.\\n\\n<http://127.0.0.1:8080> is accessible from both macOS and Linux.\\n\\nFor the usage of containerd and nerdctl (contaiNERD ctl), visit <https://github.com/containerd/containerd> and <https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl>.\\n\\n## Getting started\\n### Installation\\n\\n[Homebrew package](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/l/lima.rb) is available.\\n\\n```console\\nbrew install lima\\n```\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Manual installation steps</summary>\\n<p>\\n\\n#### Install QEMU\\n\\nInstall QEMU 7.0 or later.\\n\\n#### Install Lima\\n\\n- Download the binary archive of Lima from <https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/releases>,\\nand extract it under `/usr/local` (or somewhere else).

It only works on older macOS versions. You can clear the codesigning with `codesign --remove-signature /usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64` and [start over](#getting-started).\\n\\n#### \"QEMU crashes with `vmx_write_mem: mmu_gva_to_gpa XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX failed`\"\\nThis error is known to happen when running an image of RHEL8-compatible distribution such as Rocky Linux 8.x on Intel Mac.\\nA workaround is to set environment variable `QEMU_SYSTEM_X86_64=\"qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu Haswell-v4\"`.\\n\\n<https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1838390>\\n\\n### VZ\\n#### \"Lima gets stuck at `Installing rosetta...`\"\\n\\nTry `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` from a terminal.\\n\\n### Networking\\n#### \"Cannot access the guest IP 192.168.5.15 from the host\"\\n\\nThe default guest IP 192.168.5.15 is not accessible from the host and other guests.\\n\\nTo add another IP address that is accessible from the host and other virtual machines, enable [`socket_vmnet`](https://github.com/lima-vm/socket_vmnet) (since Lima v0.12)\\nor [`vde_vmnet`](https://github.com/lima-vm/vde_vmnet) (Deprecated).\\n\\nSee [`./docs/network.md`](./docs/network.md).\\n\\n#### \"Ping shows duplicate packets and massive response times\"\\n\\nLima uses QEMU\\'s SLIRP networking which does not support `ping` out of the box:\\n\\n```console\\n$ ping google.com\\nPING google.com (172.217.165.14): 56 data bytes\\n64 bytes from 172.217.165.14: seq=0 ttl=42 time=2395159.646 ms\\n64 bytes from 172.217.165.14: seq=0 ttl=42 time=2396160.798 ms (DUP!)\\n```\\n\\nFor more details, see [Documentation/Networking](https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/Networking#User_Networking_.28SLIRP.29).\\n\\n#### \"IP address is not assigined for vmnet networks\"\\nTry the following commands:\\n```bash\\n/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/libexec/bootpd\\n/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --unblock /usr/libexec/bootpd\\n```\\n\\n### Filesystem sharing\\n#### \"Filesystem is slow\"\\nTry virtiofs.

The runtime offers isolation and protection for operating system resources (e.g., file system, sockets, environment variables, processes) and memory space. The most important use case for WasmEdge is to safely execute user-defined or community-contributed code as plug-ins in a software product (e.g., SaaS, software-defined vehicles, edge nodes, or even blockchain nodes). It enables third-party developers, vendors, suppliers, and community members to extend and customize the software product. **[Learn more here](https://wasmedge.org/docs/contribute/users)**\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\n* [A Lightweight Design for High-performance Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07115), published on IEEE Software, Jan 2021.

It exposes Prometheus metrics and supports\\n  exporting network flow information to collectors and analyzers.\\n* **Network observability and analytics**: Antrea + [Theia](https://github.com/antrea-io/theia)\\n  enable fine-grained visibility into the communication among Kubernetes\\n  workloads. Theia provides visualization for Antrea network flows in Grafana\\n  dashboards, and recommends Network Policies to secure the workloads.\\n* **Network Policies for virtual machines**: Antrea native policies can be\\n  enforced on non-Kubernetes Nodes including VMs and baremetal servers. Project\\n  [Nephe](https://github.com/antrea-io/nephe) implements security policies for\\n  VMs across clouds, leveraging Antrea native policies.\\n* **Encryption**: Encryption of inter-Node Pod traffic with IPsec or WireGuard\\n  tunnels.\\n* **Easy deployment**: Antrea is deployed by applying a single YAML manifest\\n  file.\\n\\nTo explore more Antrea features and their usage, check the [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md#features)\\ndocument and user guides in the [Antrea documentation folder](docs/).

This figure shows Kubernetes CNI Plugin landscape before and after CNI-Genie\\n   ![image](docs/multiple-cni-plugins/what-cni-genie.png)\\n    - User-story: based on \"performance\" requirements, \"application\" requirements, “workload placement” requirements, the user could be interested to use different CNI plugins for different application groups\\n    - Different CNI plugins are different in terms of need for port-mapping, NAT, tunneling, interrupting host ports/interfaces\\n    \\n[Watch multiple CNI plugins demo](https://github.com/cni-genie/CNI-Genie/blob/master/docs/multiple-cni-plugins/README.md#demo)\\n\\n\\n2. [Multiple NICs per container & per pod](docs/multiple-ips/README.md). The user can select multiple NICs to be added to a container upon creating them. Each NIC can get an IP address from an existing CNI plugin of choice. This makes the container reachable across multiple networks. Some use-cases from [SIG-Network](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/wiki/SIG-Network) are depicted in the figure below\\n   ![image](docs/multiple-ips/multi-interface.PNG)\\n        \\n[Watch multi-NICs per \\'container\\' demo](https://github.com/cni-genie/CNI-Genie/blob/master/docs/multiple-ips/README.md#demo)\\n\\n[Watch multi-NICs per \\'pod\\' demo](https://github.com/cni-genie/CNI-Genie/blob/master/docs/multiple-ips/README.md#feature-2-extension-cni-genie-multiple-ip-addresses-per-pod) (IP addresses assigned not only to the container, but also to the Pod)\\n\\n3. [Network Attachment Definition](docs/network-attachment-definitions/README.md). CNI-Genie supports [NPWG Multi-Network Specification v1](https://github.com/K8sNetworkPlumbingWG/multi-net-spec) style network attachment to pods, where pods can be assigned IP according to network-attachment-definition CRD objects created by user.\\n\\n4. The user can leave the CNI plugin selection to CNI-Genie. CNI-Genie watches the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) that is of interest to the user and [selects the CNI plugin](docs/smart-cni-genie/README.md), accordingly.\\n    - CNI Genie watches KPI(s) of interest for existing CNI plugins, e.g., occupancy rate, number of subnets, latency, bandwidth\\n\\n[Watch Smart CNI Plugin Selection demo](https://github.com/cni-genie/CNI-Genie/blob/master/docs/smart-cni-genie/README.md#demo)\\n\\n\\n5. [Default plugin support](docs/default-plugin/README.md). Another useful feature from genie. Using this, we can ensure to get ip address(es) for a pod by selecting default set of plugins\\n\\n\\n6. Network isolation, i.e.,\\n    - Dedicated \\'physical\\' network for a tenant\\n    - Isolated \\'logical\\' networks for different tenants on a shared \\'physical\\'network\\n\\n    Usecase : [Obtaining Pod Ip address from customized subnet](docs/network-isolation/README.md)\\n\\n\\n7. [CNI-Genie network policy engine](docs/network-policy/README.md) for network level ACLs\\n\\n\\n8. Real-time switching between different (physical or logical) networks for a given workload. This allows for\\n    - Price minimization: dynamically switching workload to a cheaper network as network prices change    \\n    - Maximizing network utilization: dynamically switching workload to the less congested network at a threshold\\n    \\n    ![image](docs/network-switching.PNG)\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: CNI-Genie itself is NOT a routing solution! It makes a call to CNI plugins that provide routing service\\n\\n### More docs here [Getting started](docs/GettingStarted.md), [CNI-Genie Feature Set](docs/CNIGenieFeatureSet.md)\\n\\n',\n",

A [separate repository contains reference plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins) and a template for making new plugins.\\n\\nThe template code makes it straight-forward to create a CNI plugin for an existing container networking project.\\nCNI also makes a good framework for creating a new container networking project from scratch.\\n\\nHere are the recordings of two sessions that the CNI maintainers hosted at KubeCon/CloudNativeCon 2019:\\n\\n- [Introduction to CNI](https://youtu.be/YjjrQiJOyME)\\n- [CNI deep dive](https://youtu.be/zChkx-AB5Xc)\\n\\n\\n## Contributing to CNI\\n\\nWe welcome contributions, including [bug reports](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/issues), and code and documentation improvements.\\nIf you intend to contribute to code or documentation, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Also see the [contact section](#contact) in this README.\\n\\nThe CNI project has a [weekly meeting](https://meet.jit.si/CNIMaintainersMeeting). It takes place Mondays at 11:00 US/Eastern. All are welcome to join.\\n\\n## Why develop CNI?\\n\\nApplication containers on Linux are a rapidly evolving area, and within this area networking is not well addressed as it is highly environment-specific.\\nWe believe that many container runtimes and orchestrators will seek to solve the same problem of making the network layer pluggable.\\n\\nTo avoid duplication, we think it is prudent to define a common interface between the network plugins and container execution: hence we put forward this specification, along with libraries for Go and a set of plugins.\\n\\n## Who is using CNI?\\n### Container runtimes\\n- [rkt - container engine](https://coreos.com/blog/rkt-cni-networking.html)\\n- [Kubernetes - a system to simplify container operations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/)\\n- [OpenShift - Kubernetes with additional enterprise features](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/openshift_networking_requirements.md)\\n- [Cloud Foundry - a platform for cloud applications](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-networking-release)\\n- [Apache Mesos - a distributed systems kernel](https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/master/docs/cni.md)\\n- [Amazon ECS - a highly scalable, high performance container management service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)\\n- [Singularity - container platform optimized for HPC, EPC, and AI](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity)\\n- [OpenSVC - orchestrator for legacy and containerized application stacks](https://docs.opensvc.com/latest/fr/agent.configure.cni.html)\\n\\n### 3rd party plugins\\n- [Project Calico - a layer 3 virtual network](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico)\\n- [Weave - a multi-host Docker network](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave)\\n- [Contiv Networking - policy networking for various use cases](https://github.com/contiv/netplugin)\\n- [SR-IOV](https://github.com/hustcat/sriov-cni)\\n- [Cilium - BPF & XDP for containers](https://github.com/cilium/cilium)\\n- [Infoblox - enterprise IP address management for containers](https://github.com/infobloxopen/cni-infoblox)\\n- [Multus - a Multi plugin](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni)\\n- [Romana - Layer 3 CNI plugin supporting network policy for Kubernetes](https://github.com/romana/kube)\\n- [CNI-Genie - generic CNI network plugin](https://github.com/Huawei-PaaS/CNI-Genie)\\n- [Nuage CNI - Nuage Networks SDN plugin for network policy kubernetes support ](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nuage-cni)\\n- [Silk - a CNI plugin designed for Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/silk)\\n- [Linen - a CNI plugin designed for overlay networks with Open vSwitch and fit in SDN/OpenFlow network environment](https://github.com/John-Lin/linen-cni)\\n- [Vhostuser - a Dataplane network plugin - Supports OVS-DPDK & VPP](https://github.com/intel/vhost-user-net-plugin)\\n- [Amazon ECS CNI Plugins - a collection of CNI Plugins to configure containers with Amazon EC2 elastic network interfaces (ENIs)](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cni-plugins)\\n- [Bonding CNI - a Link aggregating plugin to address failover and high availability network](https://github.com/Intel-Corp/bond-cni)\\n- [ovn-kubernetes - an container network plugin built on Open vSwitch (OVS) and Open Virtual Networking (OVN) with support for both Linux and Windows](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovn-kubernetes)\\n- [Juniper Contrail](https://www.juniper.net/cloud) / [TungstenFabric](https://tungstenfabric.io) -  Provides overlay SDN solution, delivering multicloud networking, hybrid cloud networking, simultaneous overlay-underlay support, network policy enforcement, network isolation, service chaining and flexible load balancing\\n- [Knitter - a CNI plugin supporting multiple networking for Kubernetes](https://github.com/ZTE/Knitter)\\n- [DANM - a CNI-compliant networking solution for TelCo workloads running on Kubernetes](https://github.com/nokia/danm)\\n- [VMware NSX – a CNI plugin that enables automated NSX L2/L3 networking and L4/L7 Load Balancing;

To use the Go language libraries in this repository, you\\'ll need a recent version of Go.  You can find the Go versions covered by our [automated tests](https://travis-ci.org/containernetworking/cni/builds) in [.travis.yaml](.travis.yml).\\n\\n### Reference Plugins\\n\\nThe CNI project maintains a set of [reference plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins) that implement the CNI specification.\\nNOTE: the reference plugins used to live in this repository but have been split out into a [separate repository](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins) as of May 2017.\\n\\n### Running the plugins\\n\\nAfter building and installing the [reference plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins), you can use the `priv-net-run.sh` and `docker-run.sh` scripts in the `scripts/` directory to exercise the plugins.\\n\\n**note - priv-net-run.sh depends on `jq`**\\n\\nStart out by creating a netconf file to describe a network:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ mkdir -p /etc/cni/net.d\\n$ cat >/etc/cni/net.d/10-mynet.conf <<EOF\\n{\\n\\t\"cniVersion\": \"0.2.0\",\\n\\t\"name\": \"mynet\",\\n\\t\"type\": \"bridge\",\\n\\t\"bridge\": \"cni0\",\\n\\t\"isGateway\": true,\\n\\t\"ipMasq\": true,\\n\\t\"ipam\": {\\n\\t\\t\"type\": \"host-local\",\\n\\t\\t\"subnet\": \"10.22.0.0/16\",\\n\\t\\t\"routes\": [\\n\\t\\t\\t{ \"dst\": \"0.0.0.0/0\" }\\n\\t\\t]\\n\\t}\\n}\\nEOF\\n$ cat >/etc/cni/net.d/99-loopback.conf <<EOF\\n{\\n\\t\"cniVersion\": \"0.2.0\",\\n\\t\"name\": \"lo\",\\n\\t\"type\": \"loopback\"\\n}\\nEOF\\n```\\n\\nThe directory `/etc/cni/net.d` is the default location in which the scripts will look for net configurations.\\n\\nNext, build the plugins:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/containernetworking/plugins\\n$ ./build_linux.sh # or build_windows.sh\\n```\\n\\nFinally, execute a command (`ifconfig` in this example) in a private network namespace that has joined the `mynet` network:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ CNI_PATH=$GOPATH/src/github.com/containernetworking/plugins/bin\\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/containernetworking/cni/scripts\\n$ sudo CNI_PATH=$CNI_PATH ./priv-net-run.sh ifconfig\\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr f2:c2:6f:54:b8:2b  \\n          inet addr:10.22.0.2  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.0.0\\n          inet6 addr: fe80::f0c2:6fff:fe54:b82b/64 Scope:Link\\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\\n          RX packets:1 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:1 overruns:0 carrier:0\\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0\\n          RX bytes:90 (90.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\\n\\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \\n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0\\n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\\n```\\n\\nThe environment variable `CNI_PATH` tells the scripts and library where to look for plugin executables.\\n\\n## Running a Docker container with network namespace set up by CNI plugins\\n\\nUse the instructions in the previous section to define a netconf and build the plugins.\\nNext, docker-run.sh script wraps `docker run`, to execute the plugins prior to entering the container:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ CNI_PATH=$GOPATH/src/github.com/containernetworking/plugins/bin\\n$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/containernetworking/cni/scripts\\n$ sudo CNI_PATH=$CNI_PATH ./docker-run.sh --rm busybox:latest ifconfig\\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr fa:60:70:aa:07:d1  \\n          inet addr:10.22.0.2  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.0.0\\n          inet6 addr: fe80::f860:70ff:feaa:7d1/64 Scope:Link\\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\\n          RX packets:1 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:1 overruns:0 carrier:0\\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0\\n          RX bytes:90 (90.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\\n\\nlo        Link encap:Local Loopback  \\n          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0\\n          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host\\n          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1\\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0\\n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\\n```\\n\\n## What might CNI do in the future?\\n\\nCNI currently covers a wide range of needs for network configuration due to its simple model and API.\\nHowever, in the future CNI might want to branch out into other directions:\\n\\n- Dynamic updates to existing network configuration\\n- Dynamic policies for network bandwidth and firewall rules\\n\\nIf these topics are of interest, please contact the team via the mailing list or IRC and find some like-minded people in the community to put a proposal together.\\n\\n## Where are the binaries?\\n\\nThe plugins moved to a separate repo:\\nhttps://github.com/containernetworking/plugins, and the releases there\\ninclude binaries and checksums.\\n\\nPrior to release 0.7.0 the `cni` release also included a `cnitool`\\nbinary; as this is a developer tool we suggest you build it yourself.\\n\\n## Contact\\n\\nFor any questions about CNI, please reach out via:\\n- Email: [cni-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cni-dev)\\n- IRC: #[containernetworking](irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#containernetworking) channel on [freenode.net](https://freenode.net/)\\n- Slack: #cni on the [CNCF slack](https://slack.cncf.io/).

It enables cloud-edge, edge-edge collaboration and solves the problems including complex configuration management, network isolation, unaware of the underlying topology, etc. It supports weak network, such as 4/5G, WiFi, etc. The main use cases are IoT, IoV, smart city, etc.\\n\\nFabEdge supports the major edge computing frameworks ,like KubeEdge/SuperEdge/OpenYurt.\\n\\nFabEdge not only supports edge nodes (remote nodes joined to the cluster via an edge computing framework such as KubeEdge), but also edge clusters (standalone K8S clusters).\\n\\nFabEdge is a sandbox project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).\\n\\n\\n## Features\\n* **Kubernetes Native**: Compatible with Kubernetes, transparent to applications.  \\n\\n* **Automatic Configuration Management**: the addresses, certificates, endpoints, tunnels, etc. are automatically managed.\\n\\n* **Cloud-Edge/Edge-Edge Collaboration**: Secure tunnels between cloud-edge, edge-edge nodes for synergy.\\n\\n* **Topology-aware Service Discovery**: reduces service access latency, by using the nearest available service endpoint.\\n\\n\\n## Advantages:\\n\\n- **Standard**: suitable for any protocol, any application.\\n- **Secure**: Uses mature and stable IPSec technology, and a secure certificate-based authentication system.\\n- **Easy to use**: Adopts the `Operator` pattern to automatically manage addresses, nodes, certificates, etc., minimizing human intervention.\\n\\n\\n## How it works\\n<img src=\"docs/images/FabEdge-Arch.png\" alt=\"fabedge-arch\" />\\n\\n* The cloud can be any Kubernetes cluster with supported CNI network plug-in, including Calico, Flannel, etc.\\n* FabEdge builds a layer-3 data plane with tunnels in additional to the control plan managed by KubeEdge, SuperEdge, OpenYurt，etc.\\n* Fabedge consists of **Operators, Connector, Agent, Cloud-Agent**.\\n* Operator monitors k8s resources such as node, service, and endpoint in the cloud, and creates a configmap for each edge node, which contains the  configuration information such as the subnet, tunnel, and load balancing rules. The operator is also responsible to manage the life cycle of agent pod for each edge node.  \\n* Connector is responsible to terminate the tunnels from edge nodes, and forward traffic between the cloud and the edge. It relies on the cloud CNI plug-in to forward traffic to other non-connector nodes in the cloud.\\n* Cloud-Agent runs on the non-connector nodes in the cluster and manages the routes to remote peers.\\n* Each edge node runs an agent and consumes its own configmap including the following functions:\\n    - Manage the configuration file of the CNI plug-in of this node\\n    - Manage the tunnels of this node\\n    - Manage the load balancing rules of this node  \\n\\n* Fab-DNS runs in all the clusters, to provide the topology-aware service discovery capability by intercepting the DNS queries.    \\n\\n\\n## FabEdge vs. Calico/Flannel/etc\\n\\nFabedge is not to replace the traditional Kubernetes network plugins such as Calico/Flannel. As in the above architecture diagram, Calico/Flannel is used within the cloud for communication between cloud nodes, while Fabedge is a complement to it for the edge-cloud, edge-edge communication. \\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\n* [Getting started](docs/get-started.md) \\n* [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md) \\n* [FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md)\\n* [Uninstall FabEdge](docs/uninstall.md)\\n* [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting-guide.md)\\n\\n\\n## Meeting\\nRegular community meeting at  2nd and 4th Thursday of every month  \\n\\nResources:  \\n[Meeting notes and agenda](https://shimo.im/docs/Wwt9TdGqgVvpDHJt)    \\n[Meeting recordings：bilibili channel](https://space.bilibili.com/524926244?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0)  \\n\\n## Contact\\nAny question, feel free to reach us in the following ways:\\n\\n· Email: fabedge@beyondcent.com  \\n.

If you already have a Kubernetes cluster without any cni plugin, please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://kubeovn.github.io/docs/stable/en/start/one-step-install/).\\n\\nIf you want to install Kubernetes from scratch, you can try [kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/blob/master/docs/kube-ovn.md) or for Chinese users try [kubeasz](https://github.com/easzlab/kubeasz/blob/master/docs/setup/network-plugin/kube-ovn.md) to deploy a production ready Kubernetes cluster with Kube-OVN embedded.\\n\\n## Documents\\n\\n- [Overview](https://kubeovn.github.io/docs/en/)\\n- [Getting Start](https://kubeovn.github.io/docs/en/start/prepare/)\\n- [User Guide](https://kubeovn.github.io/docs/en/guide/setup-options/)\\n- [Operations](https://kubeovn.github.io/docs/en/ops/kubectl-ko/)\\n- [Advanced Usage](https://kubeovn.github.io/docs/en/advance/multi-nic/)\\n- [Reference](https://kubeovn.github.io/docs/en/reference/architecture/)\\n\\n## Contribution\\nWe are looking forward to your PR!\\n\\n- [Development Guide](https://kubeovn.github.io/docs/en/reference/dev-env/)\\n- [Architecture Guide](https://kubeovn.github.io/docs/en/reference/architecture/)\\n\\n\\n## FAQ\\n0. Q: What\\'s the different with other CNIs?\\n   \\n   A: Different CNI Implementations have different scopes, there is no single implementation that can resolve all network problems. Kube-OVN is aiming to bring SDN to Cloud Native. \\n      If you are missing the old day network concepts like VPC, Subnet, customize route, security groups etc. you can not find corresponding functions in any other CNIs. Then Kube-OVN\\n      is your only choice when you need these functions to build datacenter or enterprise network fabric.\\n\\n2. Q: How about the scalability of Kube-OVN?\\n\\n   A: We have simulated 200 Nodes with 10k Pods by kubemark, and it works fine. Some community users have deployed one cluster with 500 Nodes and 10k+ Pods in production. It\\'s still not reach the limitation, but we don\\'t have enough resources to find the limitation.\\n\\n3. Q: What\\'s the Addressing/IPAM? Node-specific or cluster-wide?\\n\\n   A: Kube-OVN uses a cluster-wide IPAM, Pod address can float to any nodes in the cluster.\\n\\n4. Q: What\\'s the encapsulation?\\n\\n   A: For overlay mode, Kube-OVN uses Geneve/Vxlan/STT to encapsulate packets between nodes. For Vlan/Underlay mode there is no encapsulation.\\n\\n<a href=\"https://trackgit.com\">\\n<img src=\"https://us-central1-trackgit-analytics.cloudfunctions.net/token/ping/l57vf80m7ckk59iv8ll5\" alt=\"trackgit-views\" />\\n</a>\\n',\n",
       " '# kube-vip\\n\\nHigh Availability and Load-Balancing\\n\\n![](https://github.com/kube-vip/kube-vip/raw/main/kube-vip.png)\\n\\n[![Build and publish main image regularly](https://github.com/kube-vip/kube-vip/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kube-vip/kube-vip/actions/workflows/main.yaml)\\n\\n## Overview\\nKubernetes Virtual IP and Load-Balancer for both control plane and Kubernetes services\\n\\nThe idea behind `kube-vip` is a small self-contained Highly-Available option for all environments, especially:\\n\\n- Bare-Metal\\n- Edge (arm / Raspberry PI)\\n- Virtualisation\\n- Pretty much anywhere else :)\\n\\n**NOTE:** All documentation of both usage and architecture are now available at [https://kube-vip.io](https://kube-vip.io).\\n\\n## Features\\n\\nKube-Vip was originally created to provide a HA solution for the Kubernetes control plane, over time it has evolved to incorporate that same functionality into Kubernetes service type [load-balancers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer).\\n\\n- VIP addresses can be both IPv4 or IPv6\\n- Control Plane with ARP (Layer 2) or BGP (Layer 3)\\n- Control Plane using either [leader election](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/client-go/tools/leaderelection) or [raft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(computer_science))\\n- Control Plane HA with kubeadm (static Pods)\\n- Control Plane HA with K3s/and others (daemonsets)\\n- Service LoadBalancer using [leader election](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/client-go/tools/leaderelection) for ARP (Layer 2)\\n- Service LoadBalancer using multiple nodes with BGP\\n- Service LoadBalancer address pools per namespace or global\\n- Service LoadBalancer address via (existing network DHCP)\\n- Service LoadBalancer address exposure to gateway via UPNP\\n- ... manifest generation, vendor API integrations and many nore...\\n\\n## Why?\\n\\nThe purpose of `kube-vip` is to simplify the building of HA Kubernetes clusters, which at this time can involve a few components and configurations that all need to be managed. This was blogged about in detail by [thebsdbox](https://twitter.com/thebsdbox/) here -> [https://thebsdbox.co.uk/2020/01/02/Designing-Building-HA-bare-metal-Kubernetes-cluster/#Networking-load-balancing](https://thebsdbox.co.uk/2020/01/02/Designing-Building-HA-bare-metal-Kubernetes-cluster/#Networking-load-balancing).\\n\\n### Alternative HA Options\\n\\n`kube-vip` provides both a floating or virtual IP address for your kubernetes cluster as well as load-balancing the incoming traffic to various control-plane replicas. At the current time to replicate this functionality a minimum of two pieces of tooling would be required:\\n\\n**VIP**:\\n- [Keepalived](https://www.keepalived.org/)\\n- [UCARP](https://ucarp.wordpress.com/)\\n- Hardware Load-balancer (functionality differs per vendor)\\n\\n\\n**LoadBalancing**:\\n- [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/)\\n- [Nginx](http://nginx.com)\\n- Hardware Load-balancer (functionality differs per vendor)\\n\\nAll of these would require a separate level of configuration and in some infrastructures multiple teams in order to implement. Also when considering the software components, they may require packaging into containers or if they’re pre-packaged then security and transparency may be an issue. Finally, in edge environments we may have limited room for hardware (no HW load-balancer) or packages solutions in the correct architectures might not exist (e.g. ARM). Luckily with `kube-vip` being written in GO, it’s small(ish) and easy to build for multiple architectures, with the added security benefit of being the only thing needed in the container.\\n\\n## Troubleshooting and Feedback\\n\\nPlease raise issues on the GitHub repository and as mentioned check the documentation at [https://kube-vip.io](https://kube-vip.io/).\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to join our community and start contributing!

A single Kubernetes cluster can not be scaled indefinitely, and managing very large Kubernetes clusters is [challenging](https://openai.com/blog/scaling-kubernetes-to-7500-nodes/). Hence, Armada is a multi-cluster scheduler built on top of several Kubernetes clusters.\\n2. Acheiving very high throughput using the in-cluster storage backend, etcd, is [challenging](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/performance/). Hence, queueing and scheduling is performed partly out-of-cluster using a specialized storage layer.\\n\\nArmada is designed primarily for machine learning, AI, and data analytics workloads, and to:\\n\\n- Manage compute clusters composed of tens of thousands of nodes in total.\\n- Schedule a thousand or more pods per second, on average.\\n- Enqueue tens of thousands of jobs over a few seconds.\\n- Divide resources fairly between users.\\n- Provide visibility for users and admins.\\n- Ensure near-constant uptime.\\n\\nArmada is a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) Sandbox project used in production at [G-Research](https://www.gresearch.co.uk/).\\n\\nFor an overview of Armada, see these videos:\\n\\n- [Armada - high-throughput batch scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT8pXYciD9A)\\n- [Building Armada - Running Batch Jobs at Massive Scale on Kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3WPxw3OUl4)\\n\\nArmada adheres to the CNCF [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nFor an overview of the architecture and design of Armada, and instructions for submitting jobs, see:\\n\\n- [Components overview](./docs/design/relationships_diagram.md)\\n- [Scheduler](./docs/design/scheduler.md)\\n- [Architecture](./docs/design/architecture.md)\\n- [User guide](./docs/user.md)\\n- [Quickstart](./docs/quickstart/index.md)\\n\\nFor a full developer guide, see:\\n\\n- [Development guide](./docs/developer.md)\\n\\nFor API reference, see:\\n- [API Documentation](./docs/developer/api.md)\\n\\nWe expect readers of the documentation to have a basic understanding of Docker and Kubernetes; see, e.g., the following links:\\n\\n- [Docker overiew](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)\\n- [Kubernetes overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/)\\n\\n## Contributions\\nThank you for considering contributing to Armada!\\nWe want everyone to feel that they can contribute to the Armada Project.\\nYour contributions are valuable, whether it\\'s fixing a bug, implementing a new feature, improving documentation, or suggesting enhancements.\\nWe appreciate your time and effort in helping make this project better for everyone.\\nFor more information about contributing to Armada see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and before proceeding to contributions see [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\\n\\n## Discussion\\n\\nIf you are interested in discussing Armada you can find us on  [![slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-armada-brightgreen.svg?logo=slack)](https://cloud-native.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FC03T9CBCEMC)\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It is designed as a micro-services-based ecosystem with the minimalist approach, leveraging only on upstream Kubernetes.\\n\\n# What\\'s the problem with the current status?\\n\\nKubernetes introduces the _Namespace_ object type to create logical partitions of the cluster as isolated *slices*. However, implementing advanced multi-tenancy scenarios, it soon becomes complicated because of the flat structure of Kubernetes namespaces and the impossibility to share resources among namespaces belonging to the same tenant. To overcome this, cluster admins tend to provision a dedicated cluster for each groups of users, teams, or departments. As an organization grows, the number of clusters to manage and keep aligned becomes an operational nightmare, described as the well known phenomena of the _clusters sprawl_.\\n\\n# Entering Capsule\\n\\nCapsule takes a different approach. In a single cluster, the Capsule Controller aggregates multiple namespaces in a lightweight abstraction called _Tenant_, basically a grouping of Kubernetes Namespaces. Within each tenant, users are free to create their namespaces and share all the assigned resources. \\n\\nOn the other side, the Capsule Policy Engine keeps the different tenants isolated from each other. _Network and Security Policies_, _Resource Quota_, _Limit Ranges_, _RBAC_, and other policies defined at the tenant level are automatically inherited by all the namespaces in the tenant. Then users are free to operate their tenants in autonomy, without the intervention of the cluster administrator. \\n\\n# Features\\n\\n## Self-Service\\n\\nLeave developers the freedom to self-provision their cluster resources according to the assigned boundaries.\\n\\n## Preventing Clusters Sprawl\\n\\nShare a single cluster with multiple teams, groups of users, or departments by saving operational and management efforts.\\n\\n## Governance\\n\\nLeverage Kubernetes Admission Controllers to enforce the industry security best practices and meet policy requirements.\\n\\n## Resources Control\\n\\nTake control of the resources consumed by users while preventing them to overtake.\\n\\n## Native Experience\\n\\nProvide multi-tenancy with a native Kubernetes experience without introducing additional management layers, plugins, or customized binaries.\\n\\n## GitOps ready\\n\\nCapsule is completely declarative and GitOps ready.\\n\\n## Bring your own device (BYOD)\\n\\nAssign to tenants a dedicated set of compute, storage, and network resources and avoid the noisy neighbors\\' effect.\\n\\n# Documentation\\n\\nPlease, check the project [documentation](https://capsule.clastix.io) for the cool things you can do with Capsule.\\n\\n# Contributions\\n\\nCapsule is Open Source with Apache 2 license and any contribution is welcome.\\n\\n## Chart Development\\n\\n### Chart Linting\\n\\nThe chart is linted with [ct](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing). You can run the linter locally with this command:\\n\\n```\\nmake helm-lint\\n```\\n\\n### Chart Documentation\\n\\nThe documentation for each chart is done with [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs). This way we can ensure that values are consistent with the chart documentation. Run this anytime you make changes to a `values.yaml` file:\\n\\n```\\nmake helm-docs\\n```\\n\\n## Community\\n\\nJoin the community, share and learn from it. You can find all the resources to how to contribute code and docs, connect with people in the [community repository](https://github.com/clastix/capsule-community).\\n\\n## Adopters\\n\\nSee the [ADOPTERS.md](ADOPTERS.md) file for a list of companies that are using Capsule.\\n\\n# Governance\\n\\nYou can find how the Capsule project is governed [here](https://capsule.clastix.io/docs/contributing/governance).\\n\\n## Maintainers\\n\\nPlease, refer to the maintainers file available [here](.github/maintainers.yaml).\\n\\n## Release process\\n\\nPlease, refer to the [documentation page](https://capsule.clastix.io/docs/contributing/release).\\n\\n# FAQ\\n\\n- Q. How to pronounce Capsule?\\n\\n  A. It should be pronounced as `/ˈkæpsjuːl/`.\\n\\n- Q. Is it production grade?\\n\\n  A. Although under frequent development and improvements, Capsule is ready to be used in production environments as currently, people are using it in public and private deployments. Check out the [release](https://github.com/clastix/capsule/releases) page for a detailed list of available versions.\\n\\n- Q. Does it work with my Kubernetes XYZ distribution?\\n\\n  A. We tested Capsule with vanilla Kubernetes 1.16+ on private environments and public clouds. We expect it to work smoothly on any other Kubernetes distribution. Please, let us know if you find it doesn\\'t.\\n\\n- Q. Do you provide commercial support?\\n\\n  A. Yes, we\\'re available to help and provide commercial support.

the [#clusterpedia](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/clusterpedia) channel.\\n\\n## Why Clusterpedia\\nClusterpedia can be deployed as a standalone platform or integrated with [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api), [Karmada](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada), [Clusternet](https://github.com/clusternet/clusternet) and other multi-cloud platforms\\n\\n### Automatic synchronization of clusters managed by multi-cloud platforms\\nThe clusterpedia can automatically synchronize the resources within the cluster managed by the multi-cloud platform.\\n\\nUsers do not need to maintain Clusterpedia manually, Clusterpedia can work as well as the internal components of the multi-cloud platforms.\\n\\nLean More About [Interfacing to Multi-Cloud Platforms](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/usage/interfacing-to-multi-cloud-platforms/)\\n\\n### More retrieval features and compatibility with **Kubernetes OpenAPI**\\n* Support for retrieving resources using `kubectl`, `client-go` or `controller-runtime/client`, [client-go example](https://github.com/clusterpedia-io/client-go/blob/main/examples/list-clusterpedia-resources/main.go)\\n* The resource metadata can be retrived via API or [client-go/metadata](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/metadata)\\n* Rich retrieval conditions: [Filter by cluster/namespace/name/creation](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/usage/search/multi-cluster/#basic-features), [Search by parent or ancestor owner](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/usage/search/multi-cluster/#search-by-parent-or-ancestor-owner),[Multi-Cluster Label Selector](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/usage/search/#label-selector), [Enhanced Field Selector](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/usage/search/#field-selector), [Custom Search Conditions](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/usage/search/#advanced-searchcustom-conditional-search), etc.\\n### Support for importing Kubernetes 1.10+\\n### Automic conversion of different versions of Kube resources and support for multiple version of resources\\n* Even if you import different version of Kube, we can still use the same resource version to retrieve resources\\n> For example, we can use `v1`, `v1beta2`, `v1beta1` version to retrieve the Deployments resources in different clusters.\\n> \\n>   Notes: The version of *deployments* is `v1beta1` in Kubernetes 1.10 and it is `v1` in Kubernetes 1.24.\\n```bash\\n$ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/clusterpedia.io/v1beta1/resources/apis/apps\" | jq\\n{\\n  \"kind\": \"APIGroup\",\\n  \"apiVersion\": \"v1\",\\n  \"name\": \"apps\",\\n  \"versions\": [\\n    {\\n      \"groupVersion\": \"apps/v1\",\\n      \"version\": \"v1\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"groupVersion\": \"apps/v1beta2\",\\n      \"version\": \"v1beta2\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"groupVersion\": \"apps/v1beta1\",\\n      \"version\": \"v1beta1\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \"preferredVersion\": {\\n    \"groupVersion\": \"apps/v1\",\\n    \"version\": \"v1\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n### A single API can be used to retrieve different types of resources\\n* Use [`Collection Resource`](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/concepts/collection-resource/) to retrieve different types of resources, such as `Deployment`, `DaemonSet`, `StatefulSet`.\\n```bash\\n$ kubectl get collectionresources\\nNAME            RESOURCES\\nany             *\\nworkloads       deployments.apps,daemonsets.apps,statefulsets.apps\\nkuberesources   .*,*.admission.k8s.io,*.admissionregistration.k8s.io,*.apiextensions.k8s.io,*.apps,*.authentication.k8s.io,*.authorization.k8s.io,*.autoscaling,*.batch,*.certificates.k8s.io,*.coordination.k8s.io,*.discovery.k8s.io,*.events.k8s.io,*.extensions,*.flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io,*.imagepolicy.k8s.io,*.internal.apiserver.k8s.io,*.networking.k8s.io,*.node.k8s.io,*.policy,*.rbac.authorization.k8s.io,*.scheduling.k8s.io,*.storage.k8s.io\\n```\\n### Diverse policies and intelligent synchronization\\n* [Wildcards](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/usage/sync-resources/#using-wildcards-to-sync-resources) can be used to sync all types of resources within a specified group or cluster.\\n* [Support for synchronizing all custom resources](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/usage/sync-resources/#sync-all-custom-resources)\\n* The type and version of resources that Clusterpedia is synchroizing with can be adapted to you CRD and AA changes\\n### Unify the search entry for master clusters and multi-cluster resources\\n* Based on [Aggregated API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/), the entry portal for multi-cluster retrieval is the same as that of the master cluster(IP:PORT)\\n### Very low memory usage and weak network optimization\\n* Optimized caches used by informer, so the memory usage is very low for resource synchronization.\\n* Automatic start/stop synchronization based on cluster health status\\n### High availability\\n### No dependency on specific storage components\\nClusterpedia does not care about storage components and uses the storage layer to attach specific storage components,\\nand will also add storage layers for **graph databases** and **ES** in the future\\n\\n## Architecture <span id=\"design\"></span>\\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"./docs/images/arch.png\" style=\"width:900px;\" /></div>\\nThe architecture consists of four parts:\\n\\n* **Clusterpedia APIServer**: Register to `Kubernetes APIServer` by the means of [Aggregated API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/) and provide services through a unified entrance\\n* **ClusterSynchro Manager**: Manage the cluster synchro that is used to synchronize cluster resources\\n* **Storage Layer**: Connect with a specific storage component and then register to Clusterpedia APIServer and ClusterSynchro Manager via a storage layer interface\\n* **Storage Component**: A specific storage facility such as **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis** or other **Graph Databases**\\n\\nIn addition, Clusterpedia will use the Custom Resource - *PediaCluster* to implement cluster authentication and configure resources for synchronization.\\n\\nClusterpedia also provides a `Default Storage Layer` that can connect with **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.\\n> Clusterpedia does not care about the specific storage components used by users,\\n> you can choose or implement the storage layer according to your own needs,\\n> and then register the storage layer in Clusterpedia as a plug-in\\n\\n---\\n[Installation](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/installation/) | [Import

CollectionResource\\nresources               clusterpedia.io/v1beta1  false   Resources\\n```\\n### Use a compatible way with Kubernetes OpenAPI\\nIt is possible to search resources via URL, but using `kubectl` may be more convenient if\\nyou [configured the cluster shortcuts for `kubectl`](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/usage/access-clusterpedia/#configure-the-cluster-shortcut-for-kubectl).\\n\\nWe can use `kubectl --cluster <cluster name>` to specify the cluster, if `<cluster name>` is `clusterpedia`,\\nit meas it is a multi-cluster search operation.\\n\\nFirst check which resources are synchronized. We cannot find a resource until it is properly synchronized:\\n```sh\\n$ kubectl --cluster clusterpedia api-resources\\nNAME                  SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION                     NAMESPACED

Owner](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/usage/search/specified-cluster/#search-by-parent-or-ancestor-owner)\\n\\n### Search for [Collection Resource](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/concepts/collection-resource/)\\nClusterpedia can also perform more advanced aggregation of resources. For example, you can use `Collection Resource` to get a set of different resources at once.\\n\\nLet\\'s first check which `Collection Resource` currently Clusterpedia supports:\\n```sh\\n$ kubectl get collectionresources\\nNAME        RESOURCES\\nany             *\\nworkloads       deployments.apps,daemonsets.apps,statefulsets.apps\\nkuberesources   .*,*.admission.k8s.io,*.admissionregistration.k8s.io,*.apiextensions.k8s.io,*.apps,*.authentication.k8s.io,*.authorization.k8s.io,*.autoscaling,*.batch,*.certificates.k8s.io,*.coordination.k8s.io,*.discovery.k8s.io,*.events.k8s.io,*.extensions,*.flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io,*.imagepolicy.k8s.io,*.internal.apiserver.k8s.io,*.networking.k8s.io,*.node.k8s.io,*.policy,*.rbac.authorization.k8s.io,*.scheduling.k8s.io,*.storage.k8s.io\\n```\\n\\nBy getting workloads, you can get a set of resources aggregated by `deployments`, `daemonsets`, and `statefulsets`, and `Collection Resource` also supports for all complex queries.\\n\\n**`kubectl get collectionresources workloads` will get the corresponding resources of all namespaces in all clusters by default:**\\n```sh\\n$ kubectl get collectionresources workloads\\nCLUSTER     GROUP   VERSION   KIND         NAMESPACE                     NAME                                          AGE\\ncluster-1   apps    v1        DaemonSet    kube-system                   vsphere-cloud-controller-manager              63d\\ncluster-2   apps    v1        Deployment   kube-system                   calico-kube-controllers                       109d\\ncluster-2   apps    v1        Deployment   kube-system                   coredns-coredns                               109d\\n```\\n> Add the collection of Daemonset in cluster-1 and some of the above output is cut out\\n\\nDue to the limitation of kubectl, you cannot use complex queries in kubectl and can only be queried by `URL Query`.\\n\\n[Lean More](https://clusterpedia.io/docs/usage/search/collection-resource/)\\n\\n## Proposals\\n### Perform more complex control over resources<span id=\"complicated\"></span>\\nIn addition to resource search, similar to Wikipedia, Clusterpedia should also have simple capability of resource control, such as watch, create, delete, update, and more.\\n\\nIn fact, a write action is implemented by double write + warning response.\\n\\n**We will discuss this feature and decide whether we should implement it according to the community needs**\\n\\n## Notes\\n### Multi-cluster network connectivity\\nClusterpedia does not actually solve the problem of network connectivity in a multi-cluster environment. You can use tools such as [tower](https://github.com/kubesphere/tower) to connect and access sub-clusters, or use [submariner](https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner) or [skupper](https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper) to solve cross-cluster network problems.\\n\\n## Contact <span id=\"contact\"></span>\\nIf you have any question, feel free to reach out to us in the following ways:\\n* [@cncf/clusterpedia slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/clusterpedia)\\n\\n> If you want to join the clusterpedia channel on CNCF slack, please **[get invite to CNCF slack](https://slack.cncf.io/)** and then join the [#clusterpedia](https://cloud-native.slack.com/messages/clusterpedia) channel.\\n\\n## Contributors\\n\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/clusterpedia-io/clusterpedia/graphs/contributors\">\\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=clusterpedia-io/clusterpedia\" />\\n</a>\\n\\nMade with [contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks).\\n\\n## License\\nCopyright 2023 the Clusterpedia Authors.

Intelligently leveraging data often creates core industry values. Managing Datasets may require features in different dimensions, such as security, version management and data acceleration. We hope to start with data acceleration to support the management of datasets. \\n\\n**Runtime**: The Runtime enforces dataset isolation/share, provides version management, and enables data acceleration by defining a set of interfaces to handle DataSets throughout their lifecycle, allowing for the implementation of management and acceleration functionalities behind these interfaces.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\n- Kubernetes version > 1.16, and support CSI\\n- Golang 1.18+\\n- Helm 3\\n\\n## Quick Start\\n\\nYou can follow our [Get Started](docs/en/userguide/get_started.md) guide to quickly start a testing Kubernetes cluster.\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nYou can see our documentation at [docs](docs/README.md) for more in-depth installation and instructions for production:\\n\\n- [English](docs/en/TOC.md)\\n- [简体中文](docs/zh/TOC.md)\\n\\nYou can also visit [Fluid Homepage](https://fluid-cloudnative.github.io) to get relevant documents.\\n\\n## Quick Demo\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Demo 1: Accelerate Remote File Accessing with Fluid</summary>\\n<pre>\\n<a href=\"http://cloud.video.taobao.com/play/u/2987821887/p/1/e/6/t/1/277753111709.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2ee9ef7de9eeb386f365a5d10f5defd12f08457f/687474703a2f2f6b756265666c6f772e6f73732d636e2d6265696a696e672e616c6979756e63732e636f6d2f5374617469632f72656d6f74655f66696c655f616363657373696e672e706e67\" alt=\"\" data-canonical-src=\"static/remote_file_accessing.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a>\\n</pre>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Demo 2: Machine Learning with Fluid</summary>\\n<pre>\\n<a href=\"http://cloud.video.taobao.com/play/u/2987821887/p/1/e/6/t/1/277528130570.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5688ab788da9f8cd057e32f3764784ce616ff0fd/687474703a2f2f6b756265666c6f772e6f73732d636e2d6265696a696e672e616c6979756e63732e636f6d2f5374617469632f6d616368696e655f6c6561726e696e672e706e67\" alt=\"\" data-canonical-src=\"static/machine_learning.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a>\\n</pre>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Demo 3: Accelerate PVC with Fluid</summary>\\n<pre>\\n<a href=\"http://cloud.video.taobao.com/play/u/2987821887/p/1/e/6/t/1/281779782703.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7343be344cfebfd53619c1c8a70530ffd43d3d96/68747470733a2f2f696d672e616c6963646e2e636f6d2f696d6765787472612f69342f363030303030303030333331352f4f31434e303164386963425031614d4a614a576a5562725f2121363030303030303030333331352d302d7462766964656f2e6a7067\" alt=\"\" data-canonical-src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/6000000003315/O1CN01d8icBP1aMJaJWjUbr_!!6000000003315-0-tbvideo.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a>\\n</pre>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details>\\n<summary>Demo 4: Preload dataset with Fluid</summary>\\n<pre>\\n<a href=\"http://cloud.video.taobao.com/play/u/2987821887/p/1/e/6/t/1/287213603893.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/6000000005626/O1CN01JJ9Fb91rQktps7K3R_!!6000000005626-0-tbvideo.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a>\\n</pre>\\n</details>\\n\\n<details open>\\n<summary>Demo 5: On-the-fly dataset cache scaling</summary>\\n<pre>\\n<a href=\"http://cloud.video.taobao.com/play/u/2987821887/p/1/e/6/t/1/302459823704.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/6000000004852/O1CN013kKkea1liGNWo2DOE_!!6000000004852-0-tbvideo.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a>\\n</pre>\\n</details>\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\nSee [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)  for the  roadmap details.

By speaking Kubernetes-native APIs and providing advanced scheduling capabilities, Karmada enables truly open, multi-cloud Kubernetes.\\n\\nKarmada aims to provide turnkey automation for multi-cluster application management in multi-cloud and hybrid cloud scenarios,\\nwith key features such as centralized multi-cloud management, high availability, failure recovery, and traffic scheduling.\\n\\n![cncf_logo](docs/images/cncf-logo.png)\\n\\nKarmada is a sandbox project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF).\\n\\n## Why Karmada:\\n- __K8s Native API Compatible__\\n    - Zero change upgrade, from single-cluster to multi-cluster\\n    - Seamless integration of existing K8s tool chain\\n\\n- __Out of the Box__\\n    - Built-in policy sets for scenarios, including: Active-active, Remote DR, Geo Redundant, etc.\\n    - Cross-cluster applications auto-scaling, failover and load-balancing on multi-cluster.\\n\\n- __Avoid Vendor Lock-in__\\n    - Integration with mainstream cloud providers\\n    - Automatic allocation, migration across clusters\\n    - Not tied to proprietary vendor orchestration\\n\\n- __Centralized Management__\\n    - Location agnostic cluster management\\n    - Support clusters in Public cloud, on-prem or edge\\n\\n- __Fruitful Multi-Cluster Scheduling Policies__\\n    - Cluster Affinity, Multi Cluster Splitting/Rebalancing\\n    - Multi-Dimension HA: Region/AZ/Cluster/Provider\\n\\n- __Open and Neutral__\\n    - Jointly initiated by Internet, finance, manufacturing, teleco, cloud providers, etc.\\n    - Target for open governance with CNCF\\n\\n\\n\\n**Notice: this project is developed in continuation of Kubernetes [Federation v1](https://github.com/kubernetes-retired/federation) and [v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed). Some basic concepts are inherited from these two versions.**\\n\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\n![Architecture](docs/images/architecture.png)\\n\\nThe Karmada Control Plane consists of the following components:\\n\\n- Karmada API Server\\n- Karmada Controller Manager\\n- Karmada Scheduler\\n\\nETCD stores the Karmada API objects, the API Server is the REST endpoint all other components talk to, and the Karmada Controller Manager performs operations based on the API objects you create through the API server.\\n\\nThe Karmada Controller Manager runs the various controllers,  the controllers watch Karmada objects and then talk to the underlying clusters\\' API servers to create regular Kubernetes resources.\\n\\n1. Cluster Controller: attach Kubernetes clusters to Karmada for managing the lifecycle of the clusters by creating cluster objects.\\n2. Policy Controller: the controller watches PropagationPolicy objects. When the PropagationPolicy object is added, it selects a group of resources matching the resourceSelector and creates ResourceBinding with each single resource object.\\n3. Binding Controller: the controller watches ResourceBinding object and create Work object corresponding to each cluster with a single resource manifest.\\n4. Execution Controller: the controller watches Work objects. When Work objects are created, it will distribute the resources to member clusters.\\n\\n\\n## Concepts\\n\\n**Resource template**: Karmada uses Kubernetes Native API definition for federated resource template, to make it easy to integrate with existing tools that already adopt on Kubernetes\\n\\n**Propagation Policy**: Karmada offers a standalone Propagation(placement) Policy API to define multi-cluster scheduling and spreading requirements.\\n- Support 1:n mapping of Policy: workload, users don\\'t need to indicate scheduling constraints every time creating federated applications.\\n- With default policies, users can just interact with K8s API\\n\\n**Override Policy**: Karmada provides standalone Override Policy API for specializing cluster relevant configuration automation. E.g.:\\n- Override image prefix according to member cluster region\\n- Override StorageClass according to cloud provider\\n\\n\\nThe following diagram shows how Karmada resources are involved when propagating resources to member clusters.\\n\\n![karmada-resource-relation](docs/images/karmada-resource-relation.png)\\n\\n## Quick Start\\n\\nThis guide will cover:\\n- Install `karmada` control plane components in a Kubernetes cluster which is known as `host cluster`.\\n- Join a member cluster to `karmada` control plane.\\n- Propagate an application by using `karmada`.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n- [Go](https://golang.org/) version v1.20+\\n- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) version v1.19+\\n- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) version v0.14.0+\\n\\n### Install the Karmada control plane\\n\\n#### 1. Clone this repo to your machine:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada\\n```\\n\\n#### 2. Change to the karmada directory:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd karmada\\n```\\n\\n#### 3. Deploy and run Karmada control plane:\\n\\nrun the following script:\\n\\n```bash\\nhack/local-up-karmada.sh\\n```\\nThis script will do the following tasks for you:\\n- Start a Kubernetes cluster to run the Karmada control plane, aka. the `host cluster`.\\n- Build Karmada control plane components based on a current codebase.\\n- Deploy Karmada control plane components on the `host cluster`.\\n- Create member clusters and join Karmada.\\n\\nIf everything goes well, at the end of the script output, you will see similar messages as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\nLocal Karmada is running.\\n\\nTo start using your Karmada environment, run:\\n  export KUBECONFIG=\"$HOME/.kube/karmada.config\"\\nPlease use \\'kubectl config use-context karmada-host/karmada-apiserver\\' to switch the host and control plane cluster.\\n\\nTo manage your member clusters, run:\\n  export KUBECONFIG=\"$HOME/.kube/members.config\"\\nPlease use \\'kubectl config use-context member1/member2/member3\\' to switch to the different member cluster.\\n```\\n\\nThere are two contexts in Karmada:\\n- karmada-apiserver `kubectl config use-context karmada-apiserver`\\n- karmada-host `kubectl config use-context karmada-host`\\n\\nThe `karmada-apiserver` is the **main kubeconfig** to be used when interacting with the Karmada control plane, while `karmada-host` is only used for debugging Karmada installation with the host cluster. You can check all clusters at any time by running: `kubectl config view`. To switch cluster contexts, run `kubectl config use-context [CONTEXT_NAME]`\\n\\n\\n### Demo\\n\\n![Demo](docs/images/sample-nginx.svg)\\n\\n### Propagate application\\nIn the following steps, we are going to propagate a deployment by Karmada.\\n\\n#### 1. Create nginx deployment in Karmada.\\nFirst, create a [deployment](samples/nginx/deployment.yaml) named `nginx`:\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl create -f samples/nginx/deployment.yaml\\n```\\n\\n#### 2. Create PropagationPolicy that will propagate nginx to member cluster\\nThen, we need to create a policy to propagate the deployment to our member cluster.\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl create -f samples/nginx/propagationpolicy.yaml\\n```\\n\\n#### 3. Check the deployment status from Karmada\\nYou can check deployment status from Karmada, don\\'t need to access member cluster:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ kubectl get deployment\\nNAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\\nnginx   2/2     2            2           20s\\n```\\n\\n## Kubernetes compatibility\\n\\n|                        | Kubernetes 1.16 | Kubernetes 1.17 | Kubernetes 1.18 | Kubernetes 1.19 | Kubernetes 1.20 | Kubernetes 1.21 | Kubernetes 1.22 | Kubernetes 1.23 | Kubernetes 1.24 | Kubernetes 1.25 | Kubernetes 1.26 |\\n|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\\n| Karmada v0.9           | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               |\\n| Karmada v0.10          | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               |\\n| Karmada v1.0           | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               |\\n| Karmada v1.1           | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               |\\n| Karmada v1.2           | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               |\\n| Karmada v1.3           | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               |\\n| Karmada v1.4           | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               |\\n| Karmada v1.5           | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               |\\n| Karmada v1.6           | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               |\\n| Karmada HEAD (master)  | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               | ✓               |\\n\\nKey:\\n* `✓` Karmada and the Kubernetes version are exactly compatible.\\n* `+` Karmada has features or API objects that may not be present in the Kubernetes version.\\n* `-` The Kubernetes version has features or API objects that Karmada can\\'t use.\\n\\n## Meeting\\n\\nRegular Community Meeting:\\n* Tuesday at 14:30 UTC+8 (Chinese)(biweekly).

The key word here is *flexible*: with CoreDNS you\\nare able to do what you want with your DNS data by utilizing plugins. If some functionality is not\\nprovided out of the box you can add it by [writing a plugin](https://coredns.io/explugins).\\n\\nCoreDNS can listen for DNS requests coming in over:\\n* UDP/TCP (go'old DNS).\\n* TLS - DoT ([RFC 7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858)).\\n* DNS over HTTP/2 - DoH ([RFC 8484](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484)).\\n* DNS over QUIC - DoQ ([RFC 9250](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9250)). \\n* [gRPC](https://grpc.io) (not a standard).\\n\\nCurrently CoreDNS is able to:\\n\\n* Serve zone data from a file; both DNSSEC (NSEC only) and DNS are supported (*file* and *auto*).\\n* Retrieve zone data from primaries, i.e., act as a secondary server (AXFR only) (*secondary*).\\n* Sign zone data on-the-fly (*dnssec*).\\n* Load balancing of responses (*loadbalance*).\\n* Allow for zone transfers, i.e., act as a primary server (*file* + *transfer*).\\n* Automatically load zone files from disk (*auto*).\\n* Caching of DNS responses (*cache*).\\n* Use etcd as a backend (replacing [SkyDNS](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns)) (*etcd*).\\n* Use k8s (kubernetes) as a backend (*kubernetes*).\\n* Serve as a proxy to forward queries to some other (recursive) nameserver (*forward*).\\n* Provide metrics (by using Prometheus) (*prometheus*).\\n* Provide query (*log*) and error (*errors*) logging.\\n* Integrate with cloud providers (*route53*).\\n* Support the CH class: `version.bind` and friends (*chaos*).\\n* Support the RFC 5001 DNS name server identifier (NSID) option (*nsid*).\\n* Profiling support (*pprof*).\\n* Rewrite queries (qtype, qclass and qname) (*rewrite* and *template*).\\n* Block ANY queries (*any*).\\n* Provide DNS64 IPv6 Translation (*dns64*).\\n\\nAnd more. Each of the plugins is documented. See [coredns.io/plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins)\\nfor all in-tree plugins, and [coredns.io/explugins](https://coredns.io/explugins) for all\\nout-of-tree plugins.\\n\\n## Compilation from Source\\n\\nTo compile CoreDNS, we assume you have a working Go setup. See various tutorials if you don’t have\\nthat already configured.\\n\\nFirst, make sure your golang version is 1.20 or higher as `go mod` support and other api is needed.\\nSee [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) for `go mod` details.\\nThen, check out the project and run `make` to compile the binary:\\n\\n~~~\\n$ git clone https://github.com/coredns/coredns\\n$ cd coredns\\n$ make\\n~~~\\n\\nThis should yield a `coredns` binary.\\n\\n## Compilation with Docker\\n\\nCoreDNS requires Go to compile. However, if you already have docker installed and prefer not to\\nsetup a Go environment, you could build CoreDNS easily:\\n\\n```\\n$ docker run --rm -i -t -v $PWD:/v -w /v golang:1.21 make\\n```\\n\\nThe above command alone will have `coredns` binary generated.\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nWhen starting CoreDNS without any configuration, it loads the\\n[*whoami*](https://coredns.io/plugins/whoami) and [*log*](https://coredns.io/plugins/log) plugins\\nand starts listening on port 53 (override with `-dns.port`), it should show the following:\\n\\n~~~ txt\\n.:53\\nCoreDNS-1.6.6\\nlinux/amd64, go1.16.10, aa8c32\\n~~~\\n\\nThe following could be used to query the CoreDNS server that is running now:\\n\\n~~~ txt\\ndig @127.0.0.1 -p 53 www.example.com\\n~~~\\n\\nAny query sent to port 53 should return some information; your sending address, port and protocol\\nused. The query should also be logged to standard output.\\n\\nThe configuration of CoreDNS is done through a file named `Corefile`. When CoreDNS starts, it will\\nlook for the `Corefile` from the current working directory. A `Corefile` for CoreDNS server that listens\\non port `53` and enables `whoami` plugin is:\\n\\n~~~ corefile\\n.:53 {\\n    whoami\\n}\\n~~~\\n\\nSometimes port number 53 is occupied by system processes. In that case you can start the CoreDNS server\\nwhile modifying the `Corefile` as given below so that the CoreDNS server starts on port 1053.\\n\\n~~~ corefile\\n.:1053 {\\n    whoami\\n}\\n~~~\\n\\nIf you have a `Corefile` without a port number specified it will, by default, use port 53, but you can\\noverride the port with the `-dns.port` flag: `coredns -dns.port 1053`, runs the server on port 1053.\\n\\nYou may import other text files into the `Corefile` using the _import_ directive.  You can use globs to match multiple\\nfiles with a single _import_ directive.\\n\\n~~~ txt\\n.:53 {\\n    import example1.txt\\n}\\nimport example2.txt\\n~~~\\n\\nYou can use environment variables in the `Corefile` with `{$VARIABLE}`.  Note that each environment variable is inserted\\ninto the `Corefile` as a single token. For example, an environment variable with a space in it will be treated as a single\\ntoken, not as two separate tokens.\\n\\n~~~ txt\\n.:53 {\\n    {$ENV_VAR}\\n}\\n~~~\\n\\nA Corefile for a CoreDNS server that forward any queries to an upstream DNS (e.g., `8.8.8.8`) is as follows:\\n\\n~~~ corefile\\n.:53 {\\n    forward . 8.8.8.8:53\\n    log\\n}\\n~~~\\n\\nStart CoreDNS and then query on that port (53). The query should be forwarded to 8.8.8.8 and the\\nresponse will be returned. Each query should also show up in the log which is printed on standard\\noutput.\\n\\nTo serve the (NSEC) DNSSEC-signed `example.org` on port 1053, with errors and logging sent to standard\\noutput. Allow zone transfers to everybody, but specifically mention 1 IP address so that CoreDNS can\\nsend notifies to it.\\n\\n~~~ txt\\nexample.org:1053 {\\n    file /var/lib/coredns/example.org.signed\\n    transfer {\\n        to * 2001:500:8f::53\\n    }\\n    errors\\n    log\\n}\\n~~~\\n\\nServe `example.org` on port 1053, but forward everything that does *not* match `example.org` to a\\nrecursive nameserver *and* rewrite ANY queries to HINFO.\\n\\n~~~ txt\\nexample.org:1053 {\\n    file /var/lib/coredns/example.org.signed\\n    transfer {\\n        to * 2001:500:8f::53\\n    }\\n    errors\\n    log\\n}\\n\\n. {\\n    any\\n    forward . 8.8.8.8:53\\n    errors\\n    log\\n}\\n~~~\\n\\nIP addresses are also allowed. They are automatically converted to reverse zones:\\n\\n~~~ corefile\\n10.0.0.0/24 {\\n    whoami\\n}\\n~~~\\nMeans you are authoritative for `0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.`.\\n\\nThis also works for IPv6 addresses. If for some reason you want to serve a zone named `10.0.0.0/24`\\nadd the closing dot: `10.0.0.0/24.` as this also stops the conversion.\\n\\nThis even works for CIDR (See RFC 1518 and 1519) addressing, i.e. `10.0.0.0/25`, CoreDNS will then\\ncheck if the `in-addr` request falls in the correct range.\\n\\nListening on TLS (DoT) and for gRPC?

with a focus on having cloud native qualities and work natively in a Kubernetes context.\\n\\nJust a single Gslb CRD to enable the Global Load Balancing:\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: k8gb.absa.oss/v1beta1\\nkind: Gslb\\nmetadata:\\n  name: test-gslb-failover\\n  namespace: test-gslb\\nspec:\\n  ingress:\\n    ingressClassName: nginx # or any other existing ingressclasses.networking.k8s.io\\n    rules:\\n      - host: failover.test.k8gb.io # Desired GSLB enabled FQDN\\n        http:\\n          paths:\\n          - path: /\\n            pathType: Prefix\\n            backend:\\n              service:\\n                name: frontend-podinfo # Service name to enable GSLB for\\n                port:\\n                  name: http\\n  strategy:\\n    type: failover # Global load balancing strategy\\n    primaryGeoTag: eu-west-1 # Primary cluster geo tag\\n```\\n\\n[Global load balancing](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/global-load-balancer-approaches), commonly referred to as GSLB (Global Server Load Balancing) solutions, has been typically the domain of proprietary network software and hardware vendors and installed and managed by siloed network teams.\\n\\nk8gb is a completely open source, cloud native, global load balancing solution for Kubernetes.\\n\\nk8gb focuses on load balancing traffic across geographically dispersed Kubernetes clusters using multiple load balancing [strategies](./docs/strategy.md) to meet requirements such as region failover for high availability.\\n\\nGlobal load balancing for any Kubernetes Service can now be enabled and managed by any operations or development teams in the same Kubernetes native way as any other custom resource.\\n\\n## Key Differentiators\\n\\n* Load balancing is based on timeproof DNS protocol which is perfect for global scope and extremely reliable\\n* No dedicated management cluster and no single point of failure\\n* Kubernetes native application health checks utilizing status of Liveness and Readiness probes for load balancing decisions\\n* Configuration with a single Kubernetes CRD of Gslb kind\\n\\n## Quick Start\\n\\nSimply run\\n\\n```sh\\nmake deploy-full-local-setup\\n```\\n\\nIt will deploy two local [k3s](https://k3s.io/) clusters via [k3d](https://k3d.io/), [expose associated CoreDNS service for UDP DNS traffic](./docs/exposing_dns.md)), and install k8gb with test applications and two sample Gslb resources on top.\\n\\nThis setup is adapted for local scenarios and works without external DNS provider dependency.\\n\\nConsult with [local playground](/docs/local.md) documentation to learn all the details of experimenting with local setup.\\n\\nOptionally, you can run `make deploy-prometheus` and check the metrics on the test clusters (http://localhost:9080, http://localhost:9081).\\n\\n## Motivation and Architecture\\n\\nk8gb was born out of the need for an open source, cloud native GSLB solution at Absa Group in South Africa.\\n\\nAs part of the bank\\'s wider container adoption running multiple, geographically dispersed Kubernetes clusters, the need for a global load balancer that was driven from the health of Kubernetes Services was required and for which there did not seem to be an existing solution.\\n\\nYes, there are proprietary network software and hardware vendors with GSLB solutions and products, however, these were costly, heavyweight in terms of complexity and adoption, and were not Kubernetes native in most cases, requiring dedicated hardware or software to be run outside of Kubernetes.\\n\\nThis was the problem we set out to solve with k8gb.\\n\\nBorn as a completely open source project and following the popular Kubernetes operator pattern, k8gb can be installed in a Kubernetes cluster and via a Gslb custom resource, can provide independent GSLB capability to any Ingress or Service in the cluster, without the need for handoffs and coordination between dedicated network teams.\\n\\nk8gb commoditizes GSLB for Kubernetes, putting teams in complete control of exposing Services across geographically dispersed Kubernetes clusters across public and private clouds.\\n\\nk8gb requires no specialized software or hardware, relying completely on other OSS/CNCF projects, has no single point of failure, and fits in with any existing Kubernetes deployment workflow (e.g. GitOps, Kustomize, Helm, etc.) or tools.\\n\\nPlease see the extended architecture documentation [here](/docs/index.md)\\n\\nInternal k8gb architecture and its components are described [here](/docs/components.md)\\n\\n## Installation and Configuration Tutorials\\n\\n* [General deployment with Infoblox

It provides the\\nfollowing features:\\n\\n- Etcd compatible API.\\n- Geo-distributed friendly deployment.\\n- Compatible with K8s.\\n\\n## Motivation\\n\\nWith the wide adoption of cloud computing, multi-cloud has become the mainstream IT architecture for enterprise customers.\\nMulti-cloud (or similarly multi-datacenter), however, obstacles data access across different cloud (or data center) providers to some extent.\\nFurther, data isolation and data fragmentation resulting from cloud barriers have become\\nimpediments to business growth. The biggest challenge of multi-datacenter\\narchitecture is how to maintain **strong data consistency** and ensure **high\\nperformance** in the race condition of multi-datacenter scenario.\\nTraditional single datacenter solutions cannot meet the\\navailability, performance, and consistency requirements of multi-data center\\nscenarios. This project targets the multi-datacenter scenario, aiming to\\nrealize a high-performance multi-cloud metadata management solution, which is\\ncritical for businesses with geo-distributed and multi-active\\ndeployment requirements.\\n\\n## Innovation\\n\\nCross-datacenter network latency is the most important factor that impacts the\\nperformance of geo-distributed systems, especially when a consensus protocol is\\nused. We know consensus protocols are popular to use to achieve high\\navailability. For instance, Etcd uses the [Raft](https://raft.github.io/)\\nprotocol, which is quite popular in recently developed systems.\\n\\nAlthough Raft is stable and easy to implement, it takes 2 RTTs to complete a\\nconsensus request from the view of a client. One RTT takes place between the\\nclient and the leader server, and the leader server takes another RTT to\\nbroadcast the message to the follower servers. In a geo-distributed environment,\\nan RTT is quite long, varying from tens of milliseconds to hundreds of\\nmilliseconds, so 2 RTTs are too long in such cases.\\n\\nWe adopt a new consensus protocol named\\n[CURP](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi19-park.pdf) to resolve the above\\nissue. Please refer to the paper for a detailed description. The main benefit of\\nthe protocol is reducing 1 RTT when contention is not too high. As far as we\\nknow, Xline is the first product to use CURP. For more protocol comparison, please\\nrefer to the [blog](https://xline.cloud/#/blog/2023-01-07-CURP%20%E2%80%94%20Revisit-the-Consensus-Protocol)\\n\\n## Performance Comparison\\n\\nWe compared Xline with Etcd in a simulated multi-cluster environment. The\\ndetails of the deployment is shown below.\\n\\n![test deployment](./img/xline_test_deployment.jpg)\\n\\nWe compared the performance with two different workloads. One is 1 key case, the\\nother is 100K key space case. Here's the test result.\\n\\n![xline key perf](./img/xline-key-perf.png)\\n\\n\\nIt's easy to tell Xline has a better performance than Etcd in a geo-distributed\\nmulti-cluster environment.\\n\\n## Xline client\\n\\nRead the document [README.md](xline-client/README.md) for more details about the Xline client SDK.\\nRead the document [README.md](xlinectl/README.md) for more details about the Xline client command line tool.\\n\\n## Quick Start\\n\\nRead the document [QUICK_START.md](doc/quick-start/README.md) for more details.\\n\\n## Contribute Guide\\n\\nRead the document [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.\\n\\n## Code of Conduct\\n\\nRead the document [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more details.\\n\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\n- v0.1 ~ v0.2\\n    - Support all major ETCD APIs\\n    - Support configuration file\\n    - Pass validation tests (All the supported etcd APIs and their validation test results can be viewed in [VALIDATION_REPORT.md](./VALIDATION_REPORT.md))\\n- v0.3 ~ v0.5\\n    - Enable persistent storage\\n    - Enable snapshot\\n    - Enable cluster membership change\\n    - Implement a k8s operator basically\\n- v0.6 ~ v0.8\\n    - Enable to export metrics to some monitoring and alerting systems\\n    - Enable SSL/TLS certificates\\n    - Provide clients implementing in different languages, like go, python (not determined). \\\\[Note: Although the Xline is etcd-compatible, we provide an Xline specific client SDK to users for better performance.

However, cloud-based load balancers are unavailable in bare-metal or on-premise environments. OpenELB allows users to create **LoadBalancer Services** in bare-metal, egde, and virtualization environments for external access, and provides the same user experience as cloud-based load balancers.\\n\\n## Core Features\\n\\n- Load balancing in BGP mode and Layer 2 mode\\n- ECMP routing and load balancing\\n- IP address pool management\\n- BGP configuration using CRDs\\n- Installation using Helm Chart\\n\\n## Quickstart\\n\\n- [Install OpenELB on Kubernetes](https://openelb.github.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-openelb-on-kubernetes/)\\n- [Install OpenELB on K3s](https://openelb.github.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-openelb-on-k3s/)\\n- [Install OpenELB on KubeSphere](https://openelb.github.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-openelb-on-kubesphere/)\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nYou can learn how to use OpenELB in a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster by following the [OpenELB Documentation](https://openelb.github.io/docs/).\\n\\n## Adopters\\n\\nOpenELB has been adopted by [many companies](./ADOPTERS.md) all over the world. If you are using OpenELB in your organization, welcome to join the end user community and add your logo to the [list](./ADOPTERS.md)!\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\n[OpenELB Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) lists the features and bug fixes for each milestone. If you have any new ideas, feature requests or suggestions, please submit a proposal.\\n\\n## Support, Discussion and Contributing\\n\\n- Join us at the [KubeSphere Slack Channel](https://kubesphere.slack.com/join/shared_invite/enQtNTE3MDIxNzUxNzQ0LTZkNTdkYWNiYTVkMTM5ZThhODY1MjAyZmVlYWEwZmQ3ODQ1NmM1MGVkNWEzZTRhNzk0MzM5MmY4NDc3ZWVhMjE#/) to get support or simply tell us that you are using OpenELB.(openelb slack channel from kubernetes will be soon)\\n- You have code or documents for OpenELB? Contributions are always welcome!

While service mesh becomes an important infrastructure for microservices, many(if not all) service mesh implementations mainly focus on HTTP protocols and treat other protocols as plain TCP traffic. Aeraki Mesh is created to provide a non-intrusive, highly extendable way to manage any layer-7 traffic in a service mesh.\\n\\nNote: Aeraki only handles non-HTTP layer-7 traffic in a service mesh, and leaves the HTTP traffic to other existing service mesh projects. (As they have already done a very good job on it, and we don\\'t want to reinvent the wheel! )\\nAeraki currently can be integrated with Istio, and it may support other service mesh projects in the future.\\n\\n## Problems to solve\\n\\nWe are facing some challenges in service meshes:\\n* Istio and other popular service mesh implementations have very limited support for layer-7 protocols other than HTTP and gRPC.\\n* Envoy RDS(Route Discovery Service) is solely designed for HTTP. Other protocols such as Dubbo and Thrift can only use listener in-line routes for traffic management, which breaks existing connections when routes change.\\n* It takes a lot of effort to introduce a proprietary protocol into a service mesh. You’ll need to write an Envoy filter to handle the traffic in the data plane, and a control plane to manage those Envoy proxies.\\n\\nThose obstacles make it very hard, if not impossible, for users to manage the traffic of other widely-used layer-7 protocols in microservices. For example, in a microservices application, we may have the below protocols:\\n\\n* RPC: HTTP, gRPC, Thrift, Dubbo, Proprietary RPC Protocol …\\n* Messaging: Kafka, RabbitMQ …\\n* Cache: Redis, Memcached …\\n* Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB …\\n\\n![ Common Layer 7 Protocols Used in Microservices ](docs/protocols.png)\\n\\nIf you have already invested a lot of effort in migrating to a service mesh, of course, you want to get the most out of it — managing the traffic of all the protocols in your microservices.\\n\\n## Aeraki\\'s approach\\n\\nTo address these problems, Aeraki Mesh provides a non-intrusive, extendable way to manage any layer-7 traffic in a service mesh.\\n![ Aeraki ](docs/aeraki-architecture.png)\\n\\nAs this diagram shows, Aeraki Mesh consists of the following components:\\n\\n* Aeraki: [Aeraki](https://github.com/aeraki-mesh/aeraki) provides high-level, user-friendly traffic management rules to operations, translates the rules to envoy filter configurations, and leverages Istio’s `EnvoyFilter` API to push the configurations to the sidecar proxies. Aeraki also serves as the RDS server for MetaProtocol proxies in the data plane. Contrary to Envoy RDS, which focuses on HTTP, Aeraki RDS is aimed to provide a general dynamic route capability for all layer-7 protocols.\\n* MetaProtocol Proxy: [MetaProtocol Proxy](https://github.com/aeraki-mesh/meta-protocol-proxy) provides common capabilities for Layer-7 protocols, such as load balancing, circuit breaker, routing, rate limiting, fault injection, and auth. Layer-7 protocols can be built on top of MetaProtocol. To add a new protocol into the service mesh, the only thing you need to do is to implement the [codec interface](https://github.com/aeraki-mesh/meta-protocol-proxy/blob/ac788327239bd794e745ce18b382da858ddf3355/src/meta_protocol_proxy/codec/codec.h#L118) and a couple of lines of configuration. If you have special requirements which can’t be accommodated by the built-in capabilities, MetaProtocol Proxy also has an application-level filter chain mechanism, allowing users to write their own layer-7 filters to add custom logic into MetaProtocol Proxy.\\n\\n[Dubbo](https://github.com/aeraki-mesh/meta-protocol-proxy/tree/master/src/application_protocols/dubbo) \\n, [Thrift](https://github.com/aeraki-mesh/meta-protocol-proxy/tree/master/src/application_protocols/thrift) \\n, [bRPC](https://github.com/aeraki-mesh/meta-protocol-proxy/tree/master/src/application_protocols/brpc)\\nand [a number of other protocols](https://github.com/aeraki-mesh/aeraki/issues/105) have been implemented based on MetaProtocol. More protocols are on the way. \\nIf you\\'re using a close-source, proprietary protocol, you can also manage it in your service mesh simply by \\n[writing a MetaProtocol codec](https://www.aeraki.net/docs/v1.1/tutorials/implement-a-custom-protocol/) for it.\\n\\nMost request/response style, stateless protocols can be built on top of the MetaProtocol Proxy. However, some protocols\\' routing policies are too \"special\" to be normalized in MetaProtocol. For example, the Redis proxy uses a slot number to map a client query to a specific Redis server node, and the slot number is computed by the key in the request. Aeraki can still manage those protocols as long as there\\'s an available Envoy Filter in the Envoy proxy side. Currently, for protocols in this category, [Redis](https://github.com/aeraki-mesh/aeraki/blob/master/docs/zh/redis.md) and Kafka are supported in Aeraki.\\n\\n## Supported protocols:\\nAeraki can manage the below protocols in a service mesh：\\n* Dubbo (Envoy native filter）\\n* Thrift (Envoy native filter)\\n* Kafka (Envoy native filter)\\n* Redis (Envoy native filter)\\n* MetaProtocol-Dubbo\\n* MetaProtocol-Thrift\\n* MetaProtocol-bRPC (A RPC protocol open-source by Baidu)\\n* MetaProtocol-tRPC (A proprietary RPC protocol used in Tencent）\\n* MetaProtocol-qza (A proprietary protocol used in Tencent Music)\\n* MetaProtocol-videoPacket (A proprietary protocol used in Tencent Media Data Platform)\\n* MetaProtocol-Others: Alauda, Tencent iGame...\\n* MetaProtocol-Private protocols: Have a private protocol? No problem, any layer-7 protocols built on top of the [MetaProtocol](https://github.com/aeraki-mesh/meta-protocol-proxy) can be managed by Aeraki\\n\\n## Supported Features:\\n  * Traffic Management\\n    * [x] Request Level Load Balancing/Locality Load Balancing (Supports Consistent Hash/Sticky Session)\\n    * [x] Circuit breaking\\n    * [x] Flexible Route Match Conditions (any properties can be exacted from layer-7 packets and used as match conditions)\\n    * [x] Dynamic route update through Aeraki MetaRDS\\n    * [x] Version Based Routing\\n    * [x] Traffic Splitting\\n    * [x] Local Rate Limit\\n    * [x] Global Rate Limit\\n    * [x] Message mutation\\n    * [x] Traffic Mirroring\\n  * Observability\\n    * [x] Request level Metrics (Request latency, count, error, etc)\\n    * [x] Distributed Tracing\\n    * [x] Access log\\n  * Security \\n    * [x] Peer Authorization on Interface/Method\\n    * [ ] Request Authorization\\n\\n> Note: Protocols built on top of MetaProtocol support all the above features in Aeraki Mesh, Envoy native filters only support some of the above features, depending on the capacities of the native filters.\\n\\n## Demo\\n\\nhttps://www.aeraki.net/docs/v1.x/quickstart/\\n\\n## Install\\n\\nhttps://www.aeraki.net/docs/v1.x/install/\\n\\n## Build\\n\\n### Pre-requirements:\\n* Golang Version >= 1.16, and related golang tools installed like `goimports`, `gofmt`, etc.\\n* Docker and Docker-Compose installed\\n\\n### Build Aeraki Binary\\n\\n```bash\\n# build aeraki binary on Linux\\nmake build\\n\\n# build aeraki binary on darwin\\nmake build IMAGE_OS=darwin\\n```\\n\\n### Build Aeraki Image\\n\\n```bash\\n# build aeraki docker image with the default latest tag\\nmake docker-build\\n\\n# build aeraki docker image with xxx tag\\nmake docker-build IMAGE_TAG=xxx\\n\\n# build aeraki e2e docker image\\nmake docker-build-e2e\\n```\\n\\n## Contribute to Aeraki\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in contributing to this project, please read [Contributing to Aeraki](CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\n## Talks\\n\\n* IstioCon 2022: [Tencent Music’s service mesh practice with Istio and Aeraki](https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2022/sessions/tencent-music-aeraki/)\\n* Istio meetup China(中文): [全栈服务网格 - Aeraki 助你在 Istio 服务网格中管理任何七层流量](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq5T3OR3iTM) \\n* IstioCon 2021: [How to Manage Any Layer-7 Traffic in an Istio Service Mesh?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBS4utF68d8)\\n\\n## Who is using Aeraki?\\n\\nSincerely thank everyone for choosing, contributing, and using Aeraki.

Istio\\'s control plane provides an abstraction\\nlayer over the underlying cluster management platform, such as Kubernetes.\\n\\nIstio is composed of these components:\\n\\n- **Envoy** - Sidecar proxies per microservice to handle ingress/egress traffic\\n   between services in the cluster and from a service to external\\n   services. The proxies form a _secure microservice mesh_ providing a rich\\n   set of functions like discovery, rich layer-7 routing, circuit breakers,\\n   policy enforcement and telemetry recording/reporting\\n   functions.\\n\\n  > Note: The service mesh is not an overlay network. It\\n  > simplifies and enhances how microservices in an application talk to each\\n  > other over the network provided by the underlying platform.\\n\\n- **Istiod** - The Istio control plane. It provides service discovery, configuration and certificate management. It consists of the following sub-components:\\n\\n    - **Pilot** - Responsible for configuring the proxies at runtime.\\n\\n    - **Citadel** - Responsible for certificate issuance and rotation.\\n\\n    - **Galley** - Responsible for validating, ingesting, aggregating, transforming and distributing config within Istio.\\n\\n- **Operator** - The component provides user friendly options to operate the Istio service mesh.\\n\\n## Repositories\\n\\nThe Istio project is divided across a few GitHub repositories:\\n\\n- [istio/api](https://github.com/istio/api). This repository defines\\ncomponent-level APIs and common configuration formats for the Istio platform.\\n\\n- [istio/community](https://github.com/istio/community). This repository contains\\ninformation on the Istio community, including the various documents that govern\\nthe Istio open source project.\\n\\n- [istio/istio](README.md). This is the main code repository. It hosts Istio\\'s\\ncore components, install artifacts, and sample programs. It includes:\\n\\n    - [istioctl](istioctl/). This directory contains code for the\\n[_istioctl_](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/commands/istioctl/) command line utility.\\n\\n    - [operator](operator/). This directory contains code for the\\n[Istio Operator](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/operator/).\\n\\n    - [pilot](pilot/). This directory\\ncontains platform-specific code to populate the\\n[abstract service model](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/#pilot), dynamically reconfigure the proxies\\nwhen the application topology changes, as well as translate\\n[routing rules](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/) into proxy specific configuration.\\n\\n    - [security](security/). This directory contains [security](https://istio.io/latest/docs/concepts/security/) related code,\\nincluding Citadel (acting as Certificate Authority), citadel agent, etc.\\n\\n- [istio/proxy](https://github.com/istio/proxy). The Istio proxy contains\\nextensions to the [Envoy proxy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) (in the form of\\nEnvoy filters) that support authentication, authorization, and telemetry collection.\\n\\n## Issue management\\n\\nWe use GitHub to track all of our bugs and feature requests. Each issue we track has a variety of metadata:\\n\\n- **Epic**. An epic represents a feature area for Istio as a whole. Epics are fairly broad in scope and are basically product-level things.\\nEach issue is ultimately part of an epic.\\n\\n- **Milestone**. Each issue is assigned a milestone. This is 0.1, 0.2, ..., or \\'Nebulous Future\\'. The milestone indicates when we\\nthink the issue should get addressed.\\n\\n- **Priority**. Each issue has a priority which is represented by the column in the [Prioritization](https://github.com/orgs/istio/projects/6) project. Priority can be one of\\nP0, P1, P2, or >P2. The priority indicates how important it is to address the issue within the milestone. P0 says that the\\nmilestone cannot be considered achieved if the issue isn\\'t resolved.\\n\\n---\\n\\n<div align=\"center\">\\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncf/artwork/master/other/cncf/horizontal/color/cncf-color.svg\" width=\"300\" alt=\"Cloud Native Computing Foundation logo\"/>\\n    <p>Istio is a <a href=\"https://cncf.io\">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> project.</p>\\n</div>\\n',\n",

Kuma is a CNCF Sandbox project.\\n\\nUnlike other service mesh solutions, Kuma innovates the service mesh ecosystem by providing ease of use, native support for both Kubernetes and VMs on both the control plane and the data plane, multi-mesh support that can cross every boundary including Kubernetes namespaces, out of the box multi-zone and multi-cluster support with automatic policy synchronization and connectivity, zero-trust, observability and compliance in one-click, support for custom workload attributes that can be leveraged to accelerate PCI and GDPR compliance, and much more.\\n\\nBelow is an example of using Kuma's attributes to route all traffic generated by any PCI-compliant service in Switzerland, to only be routed within the Swiss region:\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1\\nkind: TrafficRoute\\nmesh: default\\nmetadata:\\n  name: ch-pci-compliance\\nspec:\\n  sources:\\n    - match:\\n        kuma.io/service: '*'\\n        kuma.io/zone: 'CH'\\n        PCI: true\\n  destinations:\\n    - match:\\n        kuma.io/service: '*'\\n  conf:\\n    loadBalancer:\\n      roundRobin: {}\\n    split:\\n      - weight: 100\\n        destination:\\n          kuma.io/service: '*'\\n          kuma.io/zone: 'CH'\\n```\\n\\nThe above example can also be applied on virtual machines via the built-in `kumactl` CLI.\\n\\nWith Kuma, our application teams can stop building connectivity management code in every service and every application, and they can rely on modern service mesh infrastructure instead to improve their efficiency and the overall agility of the organization:\\n\\n[![][kuma-benefits]][kuma-url]\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n* **Universal Control Plane**: Easy to use, distributed, runs anywhere on both Kubernetes and VM/Bare Metal.\\n* **Lightweight Data Plane**: Powered by Envoy to process any L4/L7 traffic, with automatic Envoy bootstrapping.\\n* **Automatic DP Injection**: No code changes required in K8s. Easy YAML specification for VM and Bare Metal deployments.\\n* **Multi-Mesh**: To setup multiple isolated Meshes in one cluster and one Control Plane, lowering OPs cost.\\n* **Single and Multi Zone**: To deploy a service mesh that is cross-platform, cross-cloud and cross-cluster.\\n* **Automatic Discovery & Ingress**: With built-in service discovery and connectivity across single and multi-zones.\\n* **Global & Remote CPs**: For scalability across deployments with multiple zones, including hybrid VMs + K8s meshes.\\n* **mTLS**: Automatic mTLS issuing, identity and encryption with optional support for third-party CA.\\n* **TLS Rotation**: Automatic certificate rotation for all the data planes, with configurable settings.\\n* **Internal & External Services**: Aggregation of internal services and support for services outside the mesh.\\n* **Traffic Permissions**: To firewall traffic between the services of a Mesh.\\n* **Traffic Routing**: With dynamic load-balancing for blue/green, canary, versioning and rollback deployments.\\n* **Fault Injection**: To harden our systems by injecting controlled artificial faults and observe the behavior.\\n* **Traffic Logs**: To log all the activity to a third-party service, like Splunk or ELK.\\n* **Traffic Tracing**: To observe the full trace of the service traffic and determine bottlenecks.\\n* **Traffic Metrics**: For every Envoy dataplane managed by Kuma with native Prometheus/Grafana support.\\n* **Retries**: To improve application reliability by automatically retrying requests.\\n* **Proxy Configuration Templating**: The easiest way to run and configure Envoy with low-level configuration.\\n* **Gateway Support**: To support any API Gateway or Ingress, like [Kong Gateway](https://github.com/Kong/kong).\\n* **Healthchecks**: Both active and passive.\\n* **GUI**: Out of the box browser GUI to explore all the Service Meshes configured in the system.\\n* **Tagging Selectors**: To apply sophisticated regional, cloud-specific and team-oriented policies.\\n* **Platform-Agnostic**: Support for Kubernetes, VMs, and bare metal. Including hybrid deployments.\\n* **Transparent Proxying**: Out of the box transparent proxying on Kubernetes, VMs and any other platform.\\n* **Network Overlay**: Create a configurable Mesh overlay across different Kubernetes clusters and namespaces.\\n\\n## Distributions\\n\\nKuma is a platform-agnostic product that ships in different distributions. You can explore the available installation options at [the official website](https://kuma.io/install).\\n\\nYou can use Kuma for modern greenfield applications built on containers as well as existing applications running on more traditional infrastructure. Kuma can be fully configured via CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) on Kubernetes and via a RESTful HTTP API in other environments that can be easily integrated with CI/CD workflows.\\n\\nKuma also provides an easy to use `kumactl` CLI client for every environment, and an official GUI that can be accessed by the browser.\\n\\n## Development\\n\\nKuma is under active development and production-ready.\\n\\nSee [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER.md) for further details.\\n\\n## Enterprise Support\\n\\nIf you are implementing Kuma in a mission-critical environment and require enterprise support and features, please visit [Enterprise](https://kuma.io/enterprise/) to explore the available offerings.\\n\\n[kuma-url]: https://kuma.io/\\n[kuma-logo]: https://kuma-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/kuma-logo-v2.png\\n[kuma-gui]: https://kuma-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/kuma-gui-v3.jpg\\n[kuma-benefits]: https://kuma-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/kuma-benefits-v2.png\\n\\n\",\n",

SchemaHero has the following goals:\\n\\n1. Database table schemas can be expressed as [Kubernetes resources](https://schemahero.io/docs/managing-tables/creating-tables/) that can be deployed to a cluster.\\n2. Database schemas can be edited and deployed to the cluster. SchemaHero will calculate the required change (`ALTER TABLE` statement) and apply it.\\n3. SchemaHero can manage databases that are deployed to the cluster, or external to the cluster (RDS, Google CloudSQL, etc).\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nThe recommended way to deploy SchemaHero is to use the kubectl plugin. Full instruction and other installation methods listed in the [documentation](https://schemahero.io/docs/installing/kubectl/).\\n\\nTo get started, read the [tutorial](https://schemahero.io/learn/tutorial/introduction) and the [full documentation](https://schemahero.io/docs/)\\n\\n# Community\\n\\nFor questions about using SchemaHero, there\\'s a [Replicated Community](https://help.replicated.com/community) forum, and a [#schemahero channel in Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/channels/schemahero). If you are interested in contributing to Schemahero, you can find more information on how to get started  on our [Community page](https://schemahero.io/community/).\\n\\nIf you\\'re a user of SchemaHero, add yourself to the [ADOPTERS](/ADOPTERS) file!\\n',\n",

Unlike other traditional NoSQL systems, TiKV not only provides classical key-value APIs, but also transactional APIs with ACID compliance. Built in Rust and powered by Raft, TiKV was originally created by [PingCAP](https://en.pingcap.com) to complement [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb), a distributed HTAP database compatible with the MySQL protocol.\\n\\nThe design of TiKV (\\'Ti\\' stands for titanium) is inspired by some great distributed systems from Google, such as BigTable, Spanner, and Percolator, and some of the latest achievements in academia in recent years, such as the Raft consensus algorithm.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in contributing to TiKV, or want to build it from source, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\n![cncf_logo](images/cncf.png#gh-light-mode-only)\\n![cncf_logo](images/cncf-white.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\\n\\nTiKV is a graduated project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who\\'s involved and how TiKV plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/09/02/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-tikv-graduation/).\\n\\n---\\n\\nWith the implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Rust and consensus state stored in RocksDB, TiKV guarantees data consistency. [Placement Driver (PD)](https://github.com/pingcap/pd/), which is introduced to implement auto-sharding, enables automatic data migration. The transaction model is similar to Google\\'s Percolator with some performance improvements. TiKV also provides snapshot isolation (SI), snapshot isolation with lock (SQL: `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), and externally consistent reads and writes in distributed transactions.\\n\\nTiKV has the following key features:\\n\\n- **Geo-Replication**\\n\\n    TiKV uses [Raft](http://raft.github.io/) and the Placement Driver to support Geo-Replication.\\n\\n- **Horizontal scalability**\\n\\n    With PD and carefully designed Raft groups, TiKV excels in horizontal scalability and can easily scale to 100+ TBs of data.\\n\\n- **Consistent distributed transactions**\\n\\n    Similar to Google\\'s Spanner, TiKV supports externally-consistent distributed transactions.\\n\\n- **Coprocessor support**\\n\\n    Similar to HBase, TiKV implements a coprocessor framework to support distributed computing.\\n\\n- **Cooperates with [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb)**\\n\\n    Thanks to the internal optimization, TiKV and TiDB can work together to be a compelling database solution with high horizontal scalability, externally-consistent transactions, support for RDBMS, and NoSQL design patterns.\\n\\n## Governance\\n\\nSee [Governance](https://github.com/tikv/community/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md).\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nFor instructions on deployment, configuration, and maintenance of TiKV,see TiKV documentation on our [website](https://tikv.org/docs/4.0/tasks/introduction/). For more details on concepts and designs behind TiKV, see [Deep Dive TiKV](https://tikv.org/deep-dive/introduction/).\\n\\n> **Note:**\\n>\\n> We have migrated our documentation from the [TiKV\\'s wiki page](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/wiki/) to the [official website](https://tikv.org/docs). The original Wiki page is discontinued. If you have any suggestions or issues regarding documentation, offer your feedback [here](https://github.com/tikv/website).\\n\\n## TiKV adopters\\n\\nYou can view the list of [TiKV Adopters](https://tikv.org/adopters/).\\n\\n## TiKV software stack\\n\\n![The TiKV software stack](images/tikv_stack.png)\\n\\n- **Placement Driver:** PD is the cluster manager of TiKV, which periodically checks replication constraints to balance load and data automatically.\\n- **Store:** There is a RocksDB within each Store and it stores data into the local disk.\\n- **Region:** Region is the basic unit of Key-Value data movement. Each Region is replicated to multiple Nodes. These multiple replicas form a Raft group.\\n- **Node:** A physical node in the cluster. Within each node, there are one or more Stores. Within each Store, there are many Regions.\\n\\nWhen a node starts, the metadata of the Node, Store and Region are recorded into PD. The status of each Region and Store is reported to PD regularly.\\n\\n## Quick start\\n\\n### Deploy a playground with TiUP\\n\\nThe most quickest to try out TiKV with TiDB is using TiUP, a component manager for TiDB.\\n\\nYou can see [this page](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/quick-start-with-tidb#deploy-a-local-test-environment-using-tiup-playground) for a step by step tutorial.\\n\\n### Deploy a playground with binary\\n\\nTiKV is able to run separately with PD, which is the minimal deployment required.\\n\\n1. Download and extract binaries.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ export TIKV_VERSION=v4.0.12\\n$ export GOOS=darwin  # only {darwin, linux} are supported\\n$ export GOARCH=amd64 # only {amd64, arm64} are supported\\n$ curl -O  https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/tikv-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz\\n$ curl -O  https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/pd-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz\\n$ tar -xzf tikv-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz\\n$ tar -xzf pd-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz\\n```\\n\\n2.

Please review the generated JSON files, which will appear as siblings to any of the markdown files in the `/specification` folder.\\n\\n### Style Guide\\n\\n- Use code blocks for examples.\\n  - Code blocks should be pseudocode, not any particular language, but should be vaguely \"Java-esque\".\\n- Use conditional requirements for requirements that only apply in particular situations, such as particular languages or runtimes.\\n- Use \"sentence case\" enclosed in ticks (\\\\`) when identifying entities outside of code blocks (ie: `evaluation details` instead of `EvaluationDetails`).\\n- Do not place line breaks into sentences, keep sentences to a single line for easier review.\\n- String literals appearing outside of code blocks should be enclosed in both ticks (\\\\`) and double-quotes (\") (ie: `\"PARSE_ERROR\"`).\\n- Use \"Title Case\" for all titles.\\n- Use the imperative mood and passive voice.\\n',\n",

It offers Stream as the main primitive for the foundation of reliable storage systems: a\\xa0*high-performance, durable, elastic, and unlimited append-only byte stream with strict ordering and consistency*.\\n\\nTo learn more about Pravega, visit https://pravega.io\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\n- Java 11+\\n\\n In spite of the requirements of using JDK 11+ to build this project, `client` artifacts (and its dependencies) must be compatible with a *Java 8* runtime. All other components are built and ran using JDK11+.\\n\\nThe `clientJavaVersion` project property determines the version used to build the client (defaults to *8*).\\n## Building Pravega\\n\\nCheckout the source code:\\n\\n```\\ngit clone https://github.com/pravega/pravega.git\\ncd pravega\\n```\\n\\nBuild the pravega distribution:\\n\\n```\\n./gradlew distribution\\n```\\n\\nInstall pravega jar files into the local maven repository. This is handy for running the `pravega-samples` locally against a custom version of pravega.\\n\\n```\\n./gradlew install\\n```\\n\\nRunning unit tests:\\n\\n```\\n./gradlew test\\n```\\n\\n## Setting up your IDE\\n\\nPravega uses [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) so you should ensure you have your IDE setup with the required plugins. Using IntelliJ is recommended.\\n\\nTo import the source into IntelliJ:\\n\\n1. Import the project directory into IntelliJ IDE. It will automatically detect the gradle project and import things correctly.\\n2. Enable `Annotation Processing` by going to `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Compiler` > `Annotation Processors` and checking \\'Enable annotation processing\\'.\\n3. Install the `Lombok Plugin`. This can be found in `Preferences` -> `Plugins`. Restart your IDE.\\n4. Pravega should now compile properly.\\n\\nFor eclipse, you can generate eclipse project files by running `./gradlew eclipse`.\\n\\n<sup> Note: Some unit tests will create (and delete) a significant amount of files. For improved performance on Windows machines, be sure to add the appropriate \\'Microsoft Defender\\' exclusion.</sup>\\n\\n## Releases\\n\\nThe latest pravega releases can be found on the [Github Release](https://github.com/pravega/pravega/releases) project page.\\n\\n## Snapshot artifacts \\n\\nAll snapshot artifacts from `master` and `release` branches are available in GitHub Packages Registry\\n\\nAdd the following to your repositories list and import dependencies as usual. \\n\\n```\\nmaven {\\n    url \"https://maven.pkg.github.com/pravega/pravega\"\\n    credentials {\\n        username = \"pravega-public\"\\n        password = \"\\\\u0067\\\\u0068\\\\u0070\\\\u005F\\\\u0048\\\\u0034\\\\u0046\\\\u0079\\\\u0047\\\\u005A\\\\u0031\\\\u006B\\\\u0056\\\\u0030\\\\u0051\\\\u0070\\\\u006B\\\\u0079\\\\u0058\\\\u006D\\\\u0035\\\\u0063\\\\u0034\\\\u0055\\\\u0033\\\\u006E\\\\u0032\\\\u0065\\\\u0078\\\\u0039\\\\u0032\\\\u0046\\\\u006E\\\\u0071\\\\u0033\\\\u0053\\\\u0046\\\\u0076\\\\u005A\\\\u0049\"\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\nNote GitHub Packages requires authentication to download packages thus credentials above are required. Use the provided password as is, please do not decode it. \\n\\nIf you need a dedicated token to use in your repository (and GitHub Actions) please reach out to us.  \\n\\nAs alternative option you can use JitPack (https://jitpack.io/#pravega/pravega) to get pre-release artifacts. \\n\\n## Quick Start\\n\\nRead [Getting Started](documentation/src/docs/getting-started/quick-start.md) page for more information, and also visit [sample-apps](https://github.com/pravega/pravega-samples) repo for more applications.\\n\\n## Running Pravega\\n\\nPravega can be installed locally or in a distributed environment.

It is designed to perform well for high-volumetric data both in terms of consumption of memory and CPU resources and in terms of latency. The goal of Tremor is to be a convenient tool for the operator at the time of configuring Tremor and at runtime in a production setup. We provide our own LSP for Tremor configurations and take great care of providing insightful metrics and helpful error messages at runtime. All this while keeping the hot data-path as performant as possible.\\n\\nTremor is well suited for ETL workloads on structured and binary data (both schemaless and strictly schematic), aggregations, traffic shaping and routing purposes. \\n\\nTremor speaks various protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, Websockets, DNS) and can connect to various external systems such as Kafka, Influx compatible stores, syslog, Open telemetry, Google Pubsub, Google BigQuery, S3 and many more.\\n\\n* [Documentation v0.12](https://tremor.rs/docs/0.12/index)\\n* [Install instructions](https://tremor.rs/docs/0.12/getting-started/install)\\n* [Guides](https://tremor.rs/docs/0.12/guides/overview)\\n* [Reference](https://tremor.rs/docs/0.12/reference/index)\\n* [Architecture overview](https://tremor.rs/docs/0.12/about/architecture)\\n\\n## Audience\\n\\nTremor is a real-time event processing engine built for users that have a high message volume to deal with and want to build pipelines to process, route, or limit this event stream. Tremor supports vast number of connectors to interact with: TCP, UDP, HTTP, Websockets, Kafka, Elasticsearch, S3 and many more.\\n\\n### When to use Tremor\\n\\n- You want to apply traffic-shaping to a high volume of incoming events\\n- You want to distribute events based on their contents\\n- You want to protect a downstream system from overload\\n- You wish to perform ETL like tasks on data.\\n\\n### When not to use Tremor\\n\\nNote: Some of those restrictions are subject to change as tremor is a growing project.\\n\\nWe currently do not recommend tremor where:\\n\\n- Your event structure is not mappable to a JSON-like data structure.\\n  - If in doubt, please reach out and create a ticket so we can assist and advice\\n  - In many cases ( textual formats ) a [preprocessor](https://www.tremor.rs/docs/artefacts/preprocessors/), [postprocessor](https://www.tremor.rs/docs/artefacts/postprocessors/) or [codec](https://www.tremor.rs/docs/artefacts/codecs/) is sufficient and these are relatively easy to contribute.\\n- You need connectivity to a system, protocol or technology that is not currently supported directly or indirectly by the existing set of [connectors](https://www.tremor.rs/docs/artefacts/connectors).\\n  - If in doubt, please reach out and create a ticket so we can assist and advise.\\n- You require complex and expensive operations on your event streams like joins of huge streams. Tremor is not built for huge analytical datasets, rather for tapping into infinite datastreams at their source (e.g. k8s events, syslog, kafka).\\n\\nWe accept and encourage contributions no matter how small so if tremor is compelling for your use case or project, then please get in touch, reach out, raise a ticket and we\\'re happy to collaborate and guide contributions and contributors.\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\nSee our [Demo](demo/README.md) for a complex Tremor setup that can easily be run locally by using docker compose.\\n\\nCheckout the [Recipes](https://www.tremor.rs/docs/recipes/README) on our website. Each comes with a docker compose file to run and play with without requiring lots of dependencies.\\n\\n## Packages\\n\\nWe do provide RPM, DEB and pre-compiled binaries (`x86_64` only) for each release.\\n\\nCheck out our [Releases Page](https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/releases).\\n\\n## Docker\\n\\nDocker images are published to both [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tremorproject/tremor) and [Github Packages Container Registry](https://ghcr.io).\\n\\n| Container registry | Image name                        |\\n| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |\\n| docker.io          | `tremorproject/tremor`            |\\n| ghcr.io            | `tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/tremor` |\\n\\nWe publish our images with a set of different tags as explained below\\n\\n| Image tags | Explanation                         | Example   |\\n| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | --------- |\\n| `edge`     | Tracking the `main` branch          |           |\\n| `latest`   | The latest release                  |           |\\n| `0.X.Y`    | The exact release                   | `0.12.1` |\\n| `0.X`      | The latest bugfix release for `0.X` | `0.12`    |\\n| `0`        | The latest minor release for `0`    | `0`       |\\n\\n### Building the Docker Image\\n\\nTremor runs in a docker image. If you wish to build a local image, clone this repository, and either run `make image` or run `docker-compose build`. Both will create an image called `tremorproject/tremor:latest`.\\n\\nNote that since the image is building tremor in release mode it requires some serious resources. We recommend allowing docker to use at least **12 but better 16 gigabytes of memory** and as many cores as there are to spare. Depending on the system building, the image can take up to an hour.\\n\\nProviding too little resources to the docker machine can destabilize the docker build process. If you\\'re encountering logs/errors like:\\n\\n```\\n(signal: 9, SIGKILL: kill)\\n# OR\\nERROR: Service \\'tremor\\' failed to build : The command \\'/bin/sh -c cargo build --release --all --verbose\\' returned a non-zero code: 101\\n```\\n\\nIt is likely that your docker resources are starved. Consider increasing your resources ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#resources)/[Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources)) before trying again, posting in Discord, or raising an issue.\\n\\n### Running\\n\\nTo run `tremor` locally and introspect its docker environment, do the following:\\n\\n```bash\\nmake image\\ndocker run tremorproject/tremor:latest\\n```\\n\\nA local shell can be acquired by finding the container id of the running docker container and using that to attach a shell to the image.\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker ps\\n```\\n\\nThis returns:\\n\\n```text\\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE                            COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\\nfa7e3b4cec86        tremorproject/tremor:latest      \"/tremor-runtime.sh\"   43 seconds ago      Up 42 seconds                           gracious_shannon\\n```\\n\\nExecuting a shell on that container will then give you local access:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker exec -it fa7e3b4cec86 sh\\n```\\n\\n## Building From Source\\n\\n> :warning: Local builds are not supported and purely at your own risk. For contributing to Tremor please checkout our [Development Quick Start Guide](https://tremor.rs/docs/0.12/development/quick-start)\\n\\nIf you are not comfortable with managing library packages on your system or don\\'t have experience with, please use the Docker image provided above. \\n\\nFor local builds, tremor requires rust 2021 (version `1.62` or later), along with all the tools needed to build rust programs. Eg: for CentOS, the packages `gcc`, `make`, `cmake`, `clang`, `openssl`, and `libstdc++` are required. For different distributions or operating systems, please install the packages accordingly.\\n**NOTE** AVX2, SSE4.2 or NEON are needed to build [simd-json](https://github.com/simd-lite/simd-json#cpu-target) used by tremor. So if you are building in vm, check which processor instruction are passed to it. Like `lscpu | grep Flags`\\nFor a more detailed guide on local builds, please refer to the [tremor development docs](https://www.tremor.rs/community/development/quick-start).\\n\\n### ARM/aarch64/NEON\\n\\nTo run and compile with neon use:\\n\\n```bash\\nRUSTCFLAGS=\"-C cpu-target=native\" cargo +nightly build --features neon --all\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Configuration\\n\\nTremor is configured using `.troy` files written in our own [Troy](https://tremor.rs/docs/0.12/language/troy/) language.\\n\\nCustom [Troy](https://tremor.rs/docs/0.12/language/troy/) modules can be loaded from any directory pointed to by the environment variable `TREMOR_PATH`.\\nDirectory entries need to be separated by a colon `:`.\\n\\n### Docker\\n\\nFor use in docker [Troy](https://tremor.rs/docs/0.12/language/troy/) files should be mounted to `/etc/tremor/config`.\\n\\nCustom [Troy](https://tremor.rs/docs/0.12/language/troy/) modules and libraries should be mounted to `/usr/local/share/tremor`.\\n### Example\\n\\nThis very simple example will consume lines from stdin and send them to stdout.\\n\\n```tremor\\ndefine flow example\\nflow\\n  # import some common pre-defined pipeline and connector definitions\\n  # to use here and save some typing\\n  use tremor::pipelines;\\n  use tremor::connectors;\\n\\n  # create instances of the connectors and pipelines we need\\n  create connector console from connectors::console;\\n  create pipeline pass from pipelines::passthrough;\\n\\n  # connect everything to form an event flow\\n  connect /connector/console to /pipeline/pass;\\n  connect /pipeline/pass to /connector/console;\\nend;\\n\\ndeploy flow example;\\n```\\n\\nRun this example in file `example.troy` with docker:\\n\\n```console\\n$ docker run -i -v\"$PWD:/etc/tremor/config\" tremorproject/tremor:latest\\n```\\n\\nPlease also look at the [demo](demo/configs/tremor/config) for a fully documented example.\\n\\nFor more involved examples check out our [Recipes](https://tremor.rs/docs/0.12/recipes/index).\\n\\n\\n## Local Demo\\n\\n**Note**: Docker should run with at least 4GB of memory!\\n\\nTo demo run `make demo`, this requires the `tremorproject/tremor` image to exist on your machine.\\n\\n### Design\\n\\nThe demo mode logically follows the flow outlined below. It reads the data from data.json.xz, sends it at a fixed rate to the `demo` bucket on Kafka and from there reads it into the tremor container to apply classification and bucketing. Finally, it off-ramps statistics of the data based on those steps.\\n\\n```text\\n╔════════════════════╗   ╔════════════════════╗   ╔════════════════════╗\\n║      loadgen       ║   ║       Kafka        ║   ║       tremor       ║\\n║ ╔════════════════╗ ║   ║ ┌────────────────┐ ║   ║ ┌────────────────┐ ║\\n║ ║ tremor-runtime ║─╬───╬▶│  bucket: demo  │─╬───╬▶│ tremor-runtime │ ║\\n║ ╚════════════════╝ ║   ║ └────────────────┘ ║   ║ └────────────────┘ ║\\n║          ▲         ║   ╚════════════════════╝   ║          │         ║\\n║          │         ║                            ║          │         ║\\n║          │         ║                            ║          ▼         ║\\n║ ┌────────────────┐ ║                            ║ ┌────────────────┐ ║\\n║ │  data.json.xz  │ ║                            ║ │     tremor     │ ║\\n║ └────────────────┘ ║                            ║ └────────────────┘ ║\\n╚════════════════════╝                            ║          │         ║\\n                                                  ║          │         ║\\n                                                  ║          ▼         ║\\n                                                  ║ ┌────────────────┐ ║\\n                                                  ║ │    grouping    │ ║\\n                                                  ║ └────────────────┘ ║\\n                                                  ║          │         ║\\n                                                  ║          │         ║\\n                                                  ║          ▼         ║\\n                                                  ║ ┌────────────────┐ ║\\n                                                  ║ │  stats output  │ ║\\n                                                  ║ └────────────────┘ ║\\n                                                  ╚════════════════════╝\\n```\\n\\n### Configuration\\n\\n#### Config file\\n\\nThe demo configuration can be inspected and changed in the `demo/configs/tremor/config/main.troy` file.\\n',\n",

It helps you easily configure complex software via reusable templates and user provided values. Ytt includes the following features:\\n- Structural templating: understands yaml structure so users can focus on their configuration instead of issues associated with text templating, such as YAML value quoting or manual template indentation\\n- Built-in programming language: includes the \"fully featured\" Python-like programming language Starlark which helps ease the burden of configuring complex software through a richer set of functionality.\\n- Reusable configuration: You can reuse the same configuration in different environments by applying environment-specific values.\\n- Custom validations: coupled with the fast and deterministic execution, allows you to take advantage of faster feedback loops when creating and testing templates\\n- Overlays: this advanced configuration helps users manage the customization required for complex software. For more, see [this example](https://carvel.dev/ytt/#example:example-overlay-files) in the online playground.\\n- Sandboxing: provides a secure, deterministic environment for execution of templates\\n\\n## Try it\\n\\nTo get started with `ytt` and to see examples, you use the online playground or download the binaries and run the playground locally.\\n\\n- Try out the [online playground](https://carvel.dev/ytt/#playground)\\n- Download the latest binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/carvel-dev/ytt/releases) and run the playground locally: `ytt website`\\n- See the examples used in the playground on the [examples](https://github.com/carvel-dev/ytt/tree/develop/examples/playground) page\\n- Editor Extensions: [vscode syntax highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ewrenn.vscode-ytt)\\n\\n### Join the Community and Make Carvel Better\\nCarvel is better because of our contributors and maintainers.

Simply add your team members and create isolated namespaces for different users and workloads.\\n\\n### Strict Namespace Isolation\\n\\n- **Automatic Service Account**: every service account is restricted by RBAC to only access its namespace\\n- **Automatic RBAC** (role-based access control) for every service account / namespace\\n- **Automatic Pod Security Policies** to ensure that users cannot break out of their pod limits\\n- **Automatic Network Policies** to isolate network traffic between namespaces (zero trust policy by default)\\n- **Automatic Resource Quotas** to limit computing and storage resources available per user and namespace\\n- **Automatic Limit Ranges** to automatically define resource limits for containers and pods\\n- **Admission Controller** to validate every API server request and to perform extensive security checks\\n\\n### Admin UI for Managing Users & Permissions\\n\\n- **Secure Invite Links** for adding users to teams and clusters while performing secure token exchange\\n- **User Management** that allows to set admins and control who can access which cluster\\n- **Limit Configuration** to define limits per namespace and user (e.g. X GB RAM, Y number of namespaces etc.)\\n- **Visual Ingress Manager** that allows developers to easily and securely expose services with a few clicks\\n\\n### Great Developer Experience\\n\\n- **On-Demand Namespace Creation and Automatic Isolation** with a single command\\n- **Automatic kubectl Context Setup** on the developer\\'s machine (+ automatic context updates)\\n- **Automatic Subdomain(s) for Every Namespace** to allow service access via ingresses\\n- **Single-Command Application Deployment** via DevSpace CLI (optional)\\n- **In-Cluster Development with Hot Reloading of Containers** via DevSpace CLI (optional)\\n\\n> **More info and install intructions for DevSpace CLI on: [www.github.com/devspace-cloud/devspace](https://github.com/devspace-cloud/devspace)**\\n\\n### Sleep Mode for Namespaces\\n\\n- **>70% Savings on Cloud Infrastructure** when cluster auto-scaling is enabled\\n- **Detects Namespace Inactivity** (kube context not used for X minutes)\\n- **Automatically Scales Down Replicas to Zero** (remembers original replica number and keeps persistent data and configuration)\\n- **Automatically Scales Up Replicas** when developers start working again (e.g. running a kubectl, helm etc. command)\\n\\n### Ships Everything Your Team Needs\\n\\n- **Automatic Ingress Controller Setup & Configuration** (optional)\\n- **Automatic Cert Manager Setup & Configuration** for automatic SSL certificate provisioning (optional)\\n- **In-Build Image Registry for Every Developer and Team** (optional)\\n- **Self-Service Signup for Users via Email, GitHub or LDAP** (optional)\\n\\n<br>\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\n![DevSpace Architecture](static/img/devspace-architecture.png)\\n\\nDevSpace Cloud can either be used [as-a-Service on devspace.cloud](https://devspace.cloud) or installed as an on-premise edition (see [www.github.com/devspace-cloud/devspace-cloud](https://github.com/devspace-cloud/devspace-cloud) for instructions).\\n\\nNo matter which edition you use, DevSpace Cloud allows you to connect any Kubernetes cluster with just a single command using DevSpace CLI: `devspace connect cluster`\\n\\nAfter connecting a cluster, DevSpace installs a lightweight control plane inside your cluster as well as optional comfort services (e.g. ingress controller, cert manager, container registry). With the visual admin UI of DevSpace Cloud, you can now generate invite links and send them to developers. You can set limits and permissions for every developer as well as for teams of developers.\\n\\nDevelopers can use DevSpace CLI to create isolated namespaces on-demand using a single command: `devspace create space`\\n\\nDevSpace CLI runs as a single binary tool directly on a developer\\'s computer and ideally, developers use it straight from their terminal within their favorite IDE. DevSpace CLI per-se does not require a server-side component as it communicates directly to the connected Kubernetes clusters using the kubectl context. However, using DevSpace Cloud in combination with DevSpace CLI allows you to provision namespaces for developers on-demand while DevSpace Cloud ensures that developers are restricted to their namespaces and stay within the limits that the cluster admins configured using the admin UI.\\n\\nWhile it is entirely possible to access the isolated namespaces directly via kubectl, helm or other tools, developers can also use DevSpace CLI to streamline the deployment process and deploy complex micro service applications with just a single command: `devspace deploy`\\n\\n**More info and install intructions for DevSpace CLI on: [www.github.com/devspace-cloud/devspace](https://github.com/devspace-cloud/devspace)**\\n\\n<br>\\n\\n## [Install DevSpace Cloud](https://devspace.cloud/cloud/docs/introduction)\\nLearn more in the **[DevSpace Cloud Documentation](https://devspace.cloud/cloud/docs/introduction)**\\n',\n",

The functionality is not added to Kubernetes itself, but rather\\nadded to a Kubernetes cluster by _running_ additional controllers and agents\\non an existing cluster.\\n\\nThe necessary controllers and agents are provided by KubeVirt.\\n\\nAs of today KubeVirt can be used to declaratively\\n\\n * Create a predefined VM\\n * Schedule a VM on a Kubernetes cluster\\n * Launch a VM\\n * Stop a VM\\n * Delete a VM\\n\\n[<img src=\"https://asciinema.org/a/497168.svg\" width=\"50%\">](https://asciinema.org/a/497168)\\n\\n## To start using KubeVirt\\n\\nTry our quickstart at [kubevirt.io](https://kubevirt.io/get_kubevirt/).\\n\\nSee our user documentation at [kubevirt.io/docs](https://kubevirt.io/user-guide).\\n\\nOnce you have the basics, you can learn more about how to run KubeVirt and its newest features by taking a look at:\\n\\n * [KubeVirt blog](https://kubevirt.io/blogs/)\\n * [KubeVirt Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2FH36TbZizw25pVT1P3C3g)\\n\\n## To start developing KubeVirt\\n\\nTo set up a development environment please read our\\n[Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md). To learn how to contribute, please read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\nYou can learn more about how KubeVirt is designed (and why it is that way),\\nand learn more about the major components by taking a look at\\n[our developer documentation](docs/):\\n\\n * [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) - High-level view on the architecture\\n * [Components](docs/components.md) - Detailed look at all components\\n * [API Reference](https://kubevirt.io/api-reference/)\\n\\n## Community\\n\\nIf you got enough of code and want to speak to people, then you got a couple\\nof options:\\n\\n* Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kubevirt)\\n* Chat with us on Slack via [#virtualization @ kubernetes.slack.com](https://kubernetes.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FC8ED7RKFE)\\n* Discuss with us on the [kubevirt-dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubevirt-dev)\\n* Stay informed about designs and upcoming events by watching our [community content](https://github.com/kubevirt/community/)\\n\\n### Related resources\\n\\n * [Kubernetes][k8s]\\n * [Libvirt][libvirt]\\n * [Cockpit][cockpit]\\n * [Kubevirt-ansible][kubevirt-ansible]\\n\\n### Submitting patches\\n\\nWhen sending patches to the project, the submitter is required to certify that\\nthey have the legal right to submit the code. This is achieved by adding a line\\n\\n    Signed-off-by: Real Name <email@address.com>\\n\\nto the bottom of every commit message. Existence of such a line certifies\\nthat the submitter has complied with the Developer\\'s Certificate of Origin 1.1,\\n(as defined in the file docs/developer-certificate-of-origin).\\n\\nThis line can be automatically added to a commit in the correct format, by\\nusing the \\'-s\\' option to \\'git commit\\'.\\n\\n## License\\n\\nKubeVirt is distributed under the\\n[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt).\\n\\n    Copyright 2016\\n\\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\\n\\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\\n\\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\\n    limitations under the License.\\n\\n[//]: # (Reference links)\\n   [k8s]: https://kubernetes.io\\n   [crd]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-custom-resource-definitions/\\n   [ovirt]: https://www.ovirt.org\\n   [cockpit]: https://cockpit-project.org/\\n   [libvirt]: https://www.libvirt.org\\n   [kubevirt-ansible]: https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt-ansible\\n\\n## FOSSA Status\\n\\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/custom%2B13072%2Fgit%40github.com%3Akubevirt%2Fkubevirt.git.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/custom%2B13072%2Fgit%40github.com%3Akubevirt%2Fkubevirt.git?ref=badge_large)\\n',\n",

This can shorten the entire development feedback loops and massively improve R&D efficiency.\\n\\nIn order to give you a better understanding of Nocalhost, it is recommended that you read our blog post [Nocalhost - Refine Cloud Native Dev Environment](https://nocalhost.dev/blog/2021/01/01/)\\n\\n[![Nocalhost](https://img.youtube.com/vi/z7I-vopn-gQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7I-vopn-gQ)\\n\\n## Key Features\\n\\n### IDE Supports\\n\\nNocalhost provides easy-to-use IDE extension for JetBrains and VSCode. These extension will enable developer to develop and debug cloud-based application in their local machine.\\n\\n## Start cloud-native application development in one click\\n\\nNo need to config complex dev environments in your local machine anymore. Nocalhost helps you to connect to any Kubernetes environment in one click.\\n\\n### See code change under a second\\n\\nautomatically synchronize the code to container every time you make a change. Nocalhost eliminate the submit, building and pushing cycles,  significantly speed up the feedback loop of development, so you see change in under a second.\\n\\n### Isolated development space\\n\\nEvery team member can enjoy their own independent development space to ensure that they are not disturbed by others.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n* [Installation](https://nocalhost.dev/docs/installation)\\n* [Quick Start](https://nocalhost.dev/docs/quick-start)\\n* [How it works](https://nocalhost.dev/docs/introduction/#how-does-it-work)\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nFull documentation is available on the [Nocalhost](https://nocalhost.dev/)\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n* Meeting: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19xrULkXK51tO0yupZnHXccC2EpJUlPI4y1eCI2HnjBM)\\n* Slack(English): [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) #nocalhost channel\\n* WeChat(Chinese): Scan the QR Code to add CODING assistance with note \"Nocalhost\", assistance will add you into our WeChat group\\n\\n![nocal-host-wechat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3713305/123894953-a2d0a480-d991-11eb-88af-9082d14b0c2c.png)\\n\\n## Talks and Conferences\\n\\n| Engagement | Link |\\n| ---------- | ---- |\\n| :video_camera: &nbsp; Nocalhost Youtube  | [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2QC6HvFG8zOtFRvvMzcAUw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2QC6HvFG8zOtFRvvMzcAUw) |\\n\\n## \\n\\nCheck our [Changelogs](https://github.com/nocalhost/nocalhost/releases)\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nCheck out [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to see how to develop with Nocalhost.\\n\\n## Code of Conduct\\n\\nNocalhost adopts [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)\\n\\n## License\\n\\nNocalhost is [Apache 2.0 licensed](./LICENSE)\\n\\n\\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fnocalhost%2Fnocalhost.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fnocalhost%2Fnocalhost?ref=badge_large)\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\nSee [ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md)\\n\\n## Contributors ✨\\n\\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\\n\\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\\n<!-- markdownlint-disable -->\\n<table>\\n  <tr>\\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/anurnomeru\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24870621?v=4?s=100\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Anur</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"#maintenance-anurnomeru\" title=\"Maintenance\">🚧</a></td>\\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.smallq.cn\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39754275?v=4?s=100\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Qi Zhang</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"#blog-zzzhangqi\" title=\"Blogposts\">📝</a></td>\\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/mouuii\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49775493?v=4?s=100\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>mouuii</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"#plugin-mouuii\" title=\"Plugin/utility libraries\">🔌</a> <a href=\"#ideas-mouuii\" title=\"Ideas, Planning, & Feedback\">🤔</a></td>\\n  </tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n<!-- markdownlint-restore -->\\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\\n\\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\\n\\nThis project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification.

Rewritten in Go, Telepresence 2 provides a simpler and more powerful user experience, improved performance, and better reliability than Telepresence 1. More details on Telepresence 2 are below.\\n\\n\\n## Walkthrough\\n\\n### Install an interceptable service:\\nStart with an empty cluster:\\n\\n```console\\n$ kubectl create deploy hello --image=registry.k8s.io/echoserver:1.4\\ndeployment.apps/hello created\\n$ kubectl expose deploy hello --port 80 --target-port 8080\\nservice/hello exposed\\n$ kubectl get ns,svc,deploy,po\\nNAME                        STATUS   AGE\\nnamespace/kube-system       Active   53m\\nnamespace/default           Active   53m\\nnamespace/kube-public       Active   53m\\nnamespace/kube-node-lease   Active   53m\\n\\nNAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE\\nservice/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.43.0.1      <none>        443/TCP   53m\\nservice/hello        ClusterIP   10.43.73.112   <none>        80/TCP    2m\\n\\nNAME                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\\ndeployment.apps/hello   1/1     1            1           2m\\n\\nNAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\npod/hello-9954f98bf-6p2k9   1/1     Running   0          2m15s\\n```\\n\\nCheck telepresence version\\n```console\\n$ telepresence version\\nClient: v2.6.7 (api v3)\\nRoot Daemon: v2.6.7 (api v3)\\nUser Daemon: v2.6.7 (api v3)\\n```\\n\\n### Setup Traffic Manager in the cluster\\n\\nInstall Traffic Manager in your cluster. By default, it will reside in the `ambassador` namespace:\\n```console\\n$ telepresence helm install\\n\\nTraffic Manager installed successfully\\n```\\n\\n### Establish a connection to  the cluster (outbound traffic)\\n\\nLet telepresence connect:\\n```console\\n$ telepresence connect\\nLaunching Telepresence Root Daemon\\nLaunching Telepresence User Daemon\\nConnected to context default (https://35.232.104.64)\\n```\\n\\nA session is now active and outbound connections will be routed to the cluster. I.e. your laptop is \"inside\" the cluster.\\n\\n```console\\n$ curl hello.default\\nCLIENT VALUES:\\nclient_address=10.42.0.189\\ncommand=GET\\nreal path=/\\nquery=nil\\nrequest_version=1.1\\nrequest_uri=http://hello.default:8080/\\n\\nSERVER VALUES:\\nserver_version=nginx: 1.10.0 - lua: 10001\\n\\nHEADERS RECEIVED:\\naccept=*/*\\nhost=hello.default\\nuser-agent=curl/7.79.1\\nBODY:\\n-no body in request-\\n```\\n\\n### Intercept the service. I.e. redirect traffic to it to our laptop (inbound traffic)\\n\\nAdd an intercept for the hello deployment on port 9000. Here, we also start a service listening on that port:\\n\\n```console\\n$ telepresence intercept hello --port 9000 -- python3 -m http.server 9000\\nUsing Deployment hello\\nintercepted\\n    Intercept name         : hello\\n    State                  : ACTIVE\\n    Workload kind          : Deployment\\n    Destination            : 127.0.0.1:9000\\n    Service Port Identifier: 80\\n    Volume Mount Point     : /tmp/telfs-524630891\\n    Intercepting           : all TCP requests\\nServing HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 9000 (http://0.0.0.0:9000/) ...\\n```\\n\\nThe `python -m httpserver` is now started on port 9000 and will run until terminated by `<ctrl>-C`. Access it from a browser using `http://hello/` or use curl from another terminal. With curl, it presents a html listing from the directory where the server was started. Something like:\\n```console\\n$ curl hello\\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\">\\n<html>\\n<head>\\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\\n<title>Directory listing for /</title>\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n<h1>Directory listing for /</h1>\\n<hr>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"file1.txt\">file1.txt</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"file2.txt\">file2.txt</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<hr>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n```\\n\\nObserve that the python service reports that it\\'s being accessed:\\n```\\n127.0.0.1 - - [16/Jun/2022 11:39:20] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\\n```\\n\\nSince telepresence is now intercepting services in the default namespace, all services in that namespace can now be reached directly by their name. You can of course still use the namespaced name too, e.g. `curl hello.default`.\\n\\n### Clean-up and close daemon processes\\n\\nEnd the service with `<ctrl>-C` and then try `curl hello.default` or `http://hello.default` again. The intercept is gone, and the echo service responds as normal. Using just `curl hello` will no longer succeed. This is because telepresence stopped mapping the default namespace when there were no more intercepts using it.\\n\\nNow end the session too. Your desktop no longer has access to the cluster internals.\\n```console\\n$ telepresence quit\\nTelepresence Network disconnecting...done\\nTelepresence Traffic Manager disconnecting...done\\n$ curl hello.default\\ncurl: (6) Could not resolve host: hello.default\\n```\\n\\nThe telepresence daemons are still running in the background, which is harmless. You\\'ll need to stop them before you\\nupgrade telepresence. That\\'s done by passing the options `-u` (stop user daemon) and `-r` (stop root daemon) to the\\nquit command.\\n\\n```console\\n$ telepresence quit -ur\\nTelepresence Network quitting...done\\nTelepresence Traffic Manager quitting...done\\n```\\n\\n### What got installed in the cluster?\\n\\nTelepresence installs the Traffic Manager in your cluster if it is not already present. This deployment remains unless you uninstall it.\\n\\nTelepresence injects the Traffic Agent as an additional container into the pods of the workload you intercept, and  will optionally install\\nan init-container to route traffic through the agent (the init-container is only injected when the service is headless or uses a numerical\\n`targetPort`). The modifications persist unless you uninstall them.\\n\\nAt first glance, we can see that the deployment is installed ...\\n```console\\n$ kubectl get svc,deploy,pod\\nservice/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.43.0.1       <none>        443/TCP                      7d22h\\nservice/hello        ClusterIP   10.43.145.57    <none>        80/TCP                       13m\\n\\nNAME                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\\ndeployment.apps/hello   1/1     1            1           13m\\n\\nNAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE\\npod/hello-774455b6f5-6x6vs   2/2     Running   0               10m\\n```\\n\\n... and that the traffic-manager is installed in the \"ambassador\" namespace.\\n\\n```console\\n$ kubectl -n ambassador get svc,deploy,pod\\nNAME                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE\\nservice/traffic-manager   ClusterIP   None           <none>        8081/TCP   17m\\nservice/agent-injector    ClusterIP   10.43.72.154   <none>        443/TCP    17m\\n\\nNAME                              READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE\\ndeployment.apps/traffic-manager   1/1     1            1           17m\\n\\nNAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\npod/traffic-manager-dcd4cc64f-6v5bp   1/1     Running   0          17m\\n```\\n\\nThe traffic-agent is installed too, in the hello pod. Here together with an init-container, because the service is using a numerical\\n`targetPort`.\\n\\n```console\\n$ kubectl describe pod hello-774455b6f5-6x6vs \\nName:

       " '# Visual Studio Code Kubernetes Tools\\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools)\\n\\nThe extension for developers building applications to run in Kubernetes clusters\\nand for DevOps staff troubleshooting Kubernetes applications.\\n\\nWorks with any Kubernetes anywhere (Azure, Minikube, AWS, GCP and more!).\\n\\nFeatures include:\\n\\n* View your clusters in an explorer tree view, and drill into workloads, services,\\n  pods and nodes.\\n* Browse Helm repos and install charts into your Kubernetes cluster.\\n* Intellisense for Kubernetes resources and Helm charts and templates.\\n* Edit Kubernetes resource manifests and apply them to your cluster.\\n* Build and run containers in your cluster from Dockerfiles in your project.\\n* View diffs of a resource\\'s current state against the resource manifest in your\\n  Git repo\\n* Easily check out the Git commit corresponding to a deployed application.\\n* Run commands or start a shell within your application\\'s pods.\\n* Get or follow logs and events from your clusters.\\n* Forward local ports to your application\\'s pods.\\n* Create Helm charts using scaffolding and snippets.\\n* Watch resources in the cluster explorer and get live updates as they change\\n\\n**What\\'s new in this version?**  See the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) to find out!\\n\\n## Getting started with the extension\\n\\n### Install\\n\\n[Open this extension in the Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools)\\n\\n### Dependencies\\n\\nThe Kubernetes extension may need to invoke the following command line tools, depending on\\nwhich features you use.  You will need `kubectl` at minimum, and `docker` or `buildah` if you plan to\\nuse the extension to build applications rather than only browse.\\n\\n* `kubectl`\\n* `docker` or `buildah`\\n* `helm`\\n\\nOptional tools:\\n* `az` (Azure CLI - only if using the extension to create or register Azure clusters)\\n* `minikube` (only if you want to use it)\\n* `git` (only if using the \\'sync working copy to repository\\' feature)\\n* `buildah` (can be used as an alternative container image build tool)\\n\\nWe recommend you install these binaries on your system PATH before using the extension.\\nIf these binaries aren\\'t on your system PATH, then some commands may not work. If the\\nextension needs one of the core Kubernetes tools and it\\'s missing, it will offer to\\ninstall it for you.\\n\\n### Configuration settings for building and running applications\\n\\nIf you want to use the `Kubernetes: Run` and `Kubernetes: Debug` features\\nthen you need to configure a user and repository for your container\\nimages. This is required because these commands need pushing an image of your application\\nfor your cluster to run it. To do this, add the following to your VS Code preferences\\n(File > Preferences):\\n\\n```javascript\\n{\\n  \"vsdocker.imageUser\": \"<your-image-prefix-here>\",\\n}\\n```\\n\\nwhere `<your-image-prefix-here>` is something like `docker.io/brendanburns`.\\n\\n**That\\'s it!  You\\'re good to go.**\\n\\n## Working with kubeconfigs\\n\\nBy default, the extension uses the active kubeconfig file -- that is, the file\\nto which the KUBECONFIG environment variable points, or the default kubeconfig\\nif no KUBECONFIG environment variable exists. You can override this using the\\n`vs-kubernetes.kubeconfig` setting in your user or workspace settings.\\n\\nIf you want to swap between multiple kubeconfig files, you can list them in the\\n`vs-kubernetes.knownKubeconfigs` configuration setting and switch between them\\nusing the `Set Kubeconfig` command.\\n\\nIf you want to skip TLS verification for a particular cluster, you can edit your ~/.kube/config and set the ```insecure-skip-tls-verify: true``` flag under the proper cluster:\\n```\\n- cluster:\\n    insecure-skip-tls-verify: true\\n    server: https://my-insecure-cluster:443\\n    name: my-insecure-cluster:443\\n```\\n\\n## Commands and features\\n\\n`vs-kubernetes-tools` supports a number of commands for interacting with Kubernetes; these are accessible via the command menu (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and may be bound to keys in the normal way.\\n\\n### Kubernetes\\n\\n#### General commands\\n\\n   * `Kubernetes: Load` - Load a resource from the Kubernetes API and create a new editor window.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Get` - Get the status for a specific resource.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Logs` - Open a view with a set of options to display/follow logs.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Follow Events` - Follow events on a selected namespace.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Show Events` - Show events on a selected namespace.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Watch` - Watch a specific resource or all resources of that object type, and update the cluster explorer as they change\\n   * `Kubernetes: Stop Watching` - Stop watching the specific resource\\n\\n#### Commands while viewing a Kubernetes manifest file\\n\\n   * `Kubernetes: Explain` - Use the `kubectl explain ...` tool to annotate Kubernetes API objects\\n   * `Kubernetes: Create` - Create an object using the current document\\n   * `Kubernetes: Delete` - Delete an object contained in the current document.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Apply` - Apply changes to an object contained in the current document.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Expose` - Expose the object in the current document as a service.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Describe` - Describe the object in a terminal window.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Diff` - Show the difference between a local copy of the object, and that which is deployed to the cluster.\\n\\n#### Commands for application directories\\n\\n   * `Kubernetes: Run` - Run the current application as a Kubernetes Deployment\\n   * `Kubernetes: Terminal` - Open an interactive terminal session in a pod of the Kubernetes Deployment\\n   * `Kubernetes: Exec` - Run a command in a pod of the Kubernetes Deployment\\n   * `Kubernetes: Debug (Launch)` - Run the current application as a Kubernetes Deployment and attach a debugging session to it (currently works only for Java/Node.js deployments). See [Debug support on Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools/blob/master/debug-on-kubernetes.md) for more details.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Debug (Attach)` - Attach a debugging session to an existing Kubernetes Deployment (currently works only for Java deployments). See [Debug support on Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools/blob/master/debug-on-kubernetes.md) for more details.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Remove Debug` - Remove the deployment and/or service created for a `Kubernetes Debug (Launch)` session\\n   * `Kubernetes: Sync Working Copy to Cluster` - Checks out the version of the code that matches what is deployed in the cluster.  (This relies on Docker image versions also being Git commit IDs, which the extension does if you use the Run command to build the container, but which typically doesn\\'t work for containers/deployments done by other means.)\\n\\n#### Cluster creation commands\\n\\n   * `Kubernetes: Create Cluster` - Initiate the flow for creating a Kubernetes cluster with a selected cloud provider (eg: Azure), or creating a Minikube cluster locally.\\n\\n#### Configuration commands\\n\\n   * `Kubernetes: Add Existing Cluster` - Install and configure the Kubernetes command line tool (kubectl) from a cloud cluster, such as an Azure Container Service (ACS) or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster\\n   * `Kubernetes: Set as Current Cluster` - Select from a list of configured clusters to set the \"current\" cluster. Used for searching, displaying, and deploying Kubernetes resources.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Delete Context` - Remove a cluster\\'s configuration from the kubeconfig file.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Set Kubeconfig` - Select from a list of known kubeconfig files (for users who keep different kubeconfig files for different environments).\\n   * `Kubernetes: Show Cluster Info` - For a cluster, show the status of Kubernetes Components (API Server, etcd, KubeDNS, etc.) in a terminal window.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Use Namespace` - Select from a list of namespaces to set the \"current\" namespace. Used for searching, displaying, and deploying Kubernetes resources.\\n\\n#### ConfigMap and Secret commands\\n\\n   * `Kubernetes: Add File` - Adds a file as a ConfigMap or a Secret\\n   * `Kubernetes: Delete File` - Deletes a file from a ConfigMap or a Secret\\n\\n#### Miscellaneous commands\\n\\n   * `Kubernetes: Open Dashboard` - Opens the Kubernetes Dashboard in your browser.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Port Forward` - Prompts user for a local port and a remote port to bind to on a Pod.\\n   * `Kubernetes: Select Pod` - It allows to select a pod from a list of pods belonging to the \"current\" namespace. It can be invoked through command substitution `${command:extension.vsKubernetesSelectPod}`. See [Commands for debugging](https://github.com/Azure/vscode-kubernetes-tools/blob/master/debug-on-kubernetes.md#2-commands-for-debugging) for more details.\\n\\n### Minikube\\n\\n[Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) runs a local, single node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM. Support is currently experimental, and requires\\nMinikube tools to be installed and available on your PATH.\\n\\n   * `Kubernetes: Start minikube` - Starts Minikube\\n   * `Kubernetes: Stop minikube` - Stops Minikube\\n\\n### Helm\\n\\n[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is the package manager for Kubernetes and provides a way for you to define, install and upgrade applications using \\'charts.\\'  This extension provides a set of tools for creating and testing Helm charts:\\n\\n   * Syntax highlighting for YAML + Helm Templates\\n   * Autocomplete for Helm, Sprig, and Go Tpl functions\\n   * Help text (on hover) for Helm, Sprig, and Go Tpl functions\\n   * Snippets for quickly scaffolding new charts and templates\\n   * Commands for...\\n     * `Helm: Create Chart` - Create a new chart\\n     * `Helm: Get Release` - Get a helm release from the cluster\\n     * `Helm: Lint` - Lint your chart\\n     * `Helm: Preview Template` - Open a preview window and preview how your template will render\\n     * `Helm: Template` - Run your chart through the template engine\\n     * `Helm: Dry Run` - Run a helm install --dry-run --debug on a remote cluster and get the results (NOTE: requires Tiller on the remote cluster)\\n     * `Helm: Version` - Get the Helm version\\n     * `Helm: Insert Dependency` - Insert a dependency YAML fragment\\n     * `Helm: Dependency Update` - Update a chart\\'s dependencies\\n     * `Helm: Package` - Package a chart directory into a chart archive\\n     * `Helm: Convert to Template` - Create a template based on an existing resource or manifest\\n     * `Helm: Convert to Template Parameter` - Convert a fixed value in a template to a parameter in the `values.yaml` file\\n   * Code lenses for:\\n     * requirements.yaml (Add and update dependencies)\\n   * Right-click on a chart .tgz file, and choose inspect chart to preview all configurable chart values.\\n\\n## Extension Settings\\n\\n  The Kubernetes extension enables variable substitution for settings that require a path as a value. Variable substitution can be done using the `${variableName}` syntax. You can find a list of the variables supported in the [variables-reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference) documentation.\\n\\n   * `vs-kubernetes` - Parent for Kubernetes-related extension settings\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.namespace` - The namespace to use for all commands\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.kubectl-path` (*deprecated*) - File path to the kubectl binary. Note this is the binary file itself, not just the directory containing the file. On Windows, this must contain the `.exe` extension. This is deprecated, please use `vscode-kubernetes.kubectl-path` instead.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.helm-path` (*deprecated*) - File path to the helm binary. Note this is the binary file itself, not just the directory containing the file. On Windows, this must contain the `.exe` extension. This is deprecated, please use `vscode-kubernetes.helm-path` instead.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.minikube-path` (*deprecated*) - File path to the minikube binary. Note this is the binary file itself, not just the directory containing the file. On Windows, this must contain the `.exe` extension. This is deprecated, please use `vscode-kubernetes.minikube-path` instead.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.kubectlVersioning` - By default, the extension uses the `kubectl` binary you provide on the system PATH or in the `vs-kubernetes.kubectl-path` configuration setting. If you set this setting to `infer`, then for each cluster the extension will attempt to identify the cluster version and download a compatible `kubectl` binary.  This improves compatibility if you have multiple Kubernetes versions in play, but may be slower.  **Note:** this setting is checked only when the extension loads; if you change it, you must reload the extension.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.kubeconfig` - File path to the kubeconfig file you want to use. This overrides both the default kubeconfig and the KUBECONFIG environment variable.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.knownKubeconfigs` - An array of file paths of kubeconfig files that you want to be able to quickly switch between using the Set Kubeconfig command.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.autoCleanupOnDebugTerminate` - The flag to control whether to auto cleanup the created deployment and associated pod by the command \"Kubernetes: Debug (Launch)\". The cleanup action occurs when it failed to start debug session or debug session terminated. If not specified, the extension will prompt for whether to clean up or not. You might choose not to clean up if you wanted to view pod logs, etc.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.outputFormat` - The output format that you prefer to view Kubernetes manifests in. One of \"yaml\" or \"json\". Defaults to \"yaml\".\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.resources-to-watch` - List of resources to be watched. To identify a resource the extension uses the label displayed in the cluster explorer. E.g. [\"Pods\", \"Services\", \"Namespaces\"].\\n       * `vscode-kubernetes.enable-snap-flag` - Enables compatibility with instances of VS Code that were installed using snap.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.disable-context-info-status-bar` - Disable displaying your current Kubernetes context in VS Code\\'s status bar. When active, it can be used to switch context from the status bar.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.disable-namespace-info-status-bar` - Disable displaying your current Kubernetes namespace in VS Code\\'s status bar. When active, it can be used to switch namespace from the status bar.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.suppress-kubectl-not-found-alerts` - Turns off the warning (and installation prompt) if `kubectl` was not found. You should not normally set this, as most of the extension depends on `kubectl`, but it can be useful if working primarily with Helm.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.suppress-helm-not-found-alerts` - Turns off the warning (and installation prompt) if `helm` was not found.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.ignore-recommendations` - Set to true to silence Kubernetes extension recommendation notifications.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.minikube-show-information-expiration` - Set to valid expiration date for minikube install to show information dialog box to display.\\n       * `vs-kubernetes.enable-minimal-workflow` - Enables the minimal workflow for several actions (Get, Describe, Scale, Expose, Switch). By executing one of those commands the queries to the cluster are reduced at minimum and users are able to freely type the resource name to use.\\n   * `vsdocker.imageUser` - Image prefix for the container images e.g. \\'docker.io/brendanburns\\'\\n   * `checkForMinikubeUpgrade` - On extension startup, notify if a minikube upgrade is available. Defaults to true.\\n   * `disable-lint` - Disable all linting of Kubernetes files\\n   * `disable-linters` - Disable specific linters by name\\n   * `vscode-kubernetes.kubectl-path` - File path to the kubectl binary. Note this is the binary file itself, not just the directory containing the file. On Windows, this must contain the `.exe` extension.\\n   * `vscode-kubernetes.helm-path` - File path to the helm binary. Note this is the binary file itself, not just the directory containing the file. On Windows, this must contain the `.exe` extension.\\n   * `vscode-kubernetes.minikube-path` - File path to the minikube binary. Note this is the binary file itself, not just the directory containing the file. On Windows, this must contain the `.exe` extension.\\n   * `vscode-kubernetes.log-viewer.follow` - Set to true to follow logs by default in the log viewer.\\n   * `vscode-kubernetes.log-viewer.timestamp` - Set to true to show timestamps by default in the log viewer.\\n   * `vscode-kubernetes.log-viewer.since` - How far back to fetch logs from in seconds by default. Set to -1 for all logs.\\n   * `vscode-kubernetes.log-viewer.tail` - The number of recent logs to display by default in the log viewer. Set to -1 for all log lines.\\n   * `vscode-kubernetes.log-viewer.destination` - Where to display logs, defaults to the dedicated Webview.\\n   * `vscode-kubernetes.log-viewer.wrap` - Set to true to wrap lines by default in the log viewer.\\n   * `vscode-kubernetes.log-viewer.autorun` - Set to true to automatically begin fetching logs once the log viewer is opened using the default settings.\\n\\n## Custom tool locations\\n\\nFor `kubectl` and `helm`, the binaries do not need to be on the system PATH. You can configure the extension by specifying the locations using the appropriate `vscode-kubernetes.${tool}-path` configuration setting.  See [Extension Settings](#extension-settings) below.\\n\\nThe extension can install `kubectl` and `helm` for you if they are missing - choose **Install dependencies** when you see an error notification for the missing tool.  This will set `kubectl-path` and `helm-path` entries in your configuration for the current OS (see \"Portable extension configuration\" below) - the programs will *not* be installed on the system PATH, but this will be sufficient for them to work with the extension.\\n\\nIf you are working with Azure Container Services or Azure Kubernetes Services, then you can install and configure `kubectl` using the `Kubernetes: Add Existing Cluster` command.\\n\\n### Portable extension configuration\\n\\nIf you move your configuration file between machines with different OSes (and therefore different paths to binaries) you can override the following settings on a per-OS basis by appending `.windows`, `.mac` or `.linux` to the setting name:\\n\\n  * `vscode-kubernetes.kubectl-path`\\n  * `vscode-kubernetes.helm-path`\\n  * `vscode-kubernetes.minikube-path`\\n\\nFor example, consider the following settings file:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"vscode-kubernetes.kubectl-path\": \"/home/foo/kubernetes/bin/kubectl\",\\n  \"vscode-kubernetes.kubectl-path-windows\": \"c:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\foo\\\\\\\\kubernetes\\\\\\\\bin\\\\\\\\kubectl.exe\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe first path would be used when invoking `kubectl` on Mac or Linux machines.  The second would be used when invoking `kubectl` on Windows machines.\\n\\n## Keybinding support\\n\\nThe following commands support arguments in keybindings:\\n\\n  * **Set Kubeconfig** (command ID `extension.vsKubernetesUseKubeconfig`) - the keybinding can specify a string argument which is the kubeconfig file path to switch to.  This allows you to set up specific keybindings for your favourite kubeconfigs.\\n\\n## Linters\\nThe extension supports linting Kubernetes YAML files for potential problems or suggestions.\\nHere are the various linters, you can enable or disable them individually using the `disable-linters` configuration value.\\n  * `resource-limits`: Warn when a Pod is missing resource limits\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"vs-kubernetes\": {\\n    \"disable-linters\": [\\n      \"resource-limits\"\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## YAML processing directives\\n\\nYou can customise how the extension processes a YAML file by putting a comment of the form\\n`# vscode-kubernetes-tools: ...directive(s)...` at the top of the file. The comment must appear before\\nany YAML elements (this saves us having to scan the whole of YAML files that could easily\\nbe tens of thousands of lines!). Other comments and blank lines are okay.\\n\\nThe following directives are supported:\\n\\n* `exclude`: Do not treat this file as a Kubernetes manifest. This is useful when you have\\n  files that look a lot like Kubernetes manifests but aren\\'t, such as Kustomize patch files.\\n\\n## Extension data\\n\\nThis extension stores its associated files and data in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/vs-kubernetes` (at `~/.local/state/vs-kubernetes` by default). However, if the legacy directory of `~/.vs-kubernetes` still exists, then that will be used instead.\\n\\n## Known issues\\n\\n  * `Kubernetes: Debug` command currently works only with Go, Node.js, Java, Python and .NET applications\\n  * For deeply nested Helm charts, template previews are generated against highest (umbrella) chart values (though for `Helm: Template` calls you can pick your chart)\\n  * When installing VS Code and/or kubectl through `snap` on a Linux system, you may face some permissions error which will prevent this extension to work correctly. As a workaround you can set up the `vs-kubernetes.enable-snap-flag` setting to `true` in your user or workspace settings.\\n\\n## Release notes\\n\\nSee the [change log](CHANGELOG.md).\\n\\n## Telemetry\\n\\nThis extension collects telemetry data to help us build a better experience for building applications with Kubernetes and VS Code. We only collect the following data:\\n\\n* Which commands are executed, and whether they are executed against an Azure, Minikube or other type of cluster.\\n* For the `Create Cluster` and `Add Existing Cluster` commands, the cluster type selected and the execution result (success/failure).\\n\\nWe do not collect any information about image names, paths, etc. We collect cluster type information only if the cluster is Azure or a local cluster such as Minikube. The extension respects the `telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting which you can learn more about in our [FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).\\n\\n## Running from source\\n\\nIf you are building and running the extension from source, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for prerequisites for the development environment.\\n\\n## Installing from VSIX\\n\\nIf you are installing the extension from its VSIX, note that the machine will still need to reach the Visual Studio Marketplace in order to download extension dependencies.  If the machine cannot reach the Marketplace, you will need to install these dependencies manually using their VSIXes.  The list of extension dependencies can be found in `package.json`, in the `extensionDependencies` section.\\n\\n## GitHub Pages Website\\n\\nThis project has a simple landing page website (visible at [vscode-kubernetes-tools.github.io/vscode-kubernetes-tools](https://vscode-kubernetes-tools.github.io/vscode-kubernetes-tools/)) which is [detailed here](https://github.com/vscode-kubernetes-tools/vscode-kubernetes-tools/tree/master/site).\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

Try Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit yourself: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/keptn/lifecycle-toolkit/)\\n\\n## Quickstart\\n\\nKeptn runs on Kubernetes. To get started, you can follow our [Quickstart guide](https://keptn.sh/docs/quickstart).\\n\\n### Developing Keptn\\n\\nThe easiest way to develop is to spin up a Kubernetes cluster locally by using [K3d](https://k3d.io) (requires `docker`) via the following commands:\\n\\n```console\\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh | TAG=v5.3.0 bash\\nk3d cluster create mykeptn -p \"8082:80@loadbalancer\" --k3s-arg \"--no-deploy=traefik@server:*\"\\n```\\n\\nAfterwards, install Keptn CLI:\\n```console\\ncurl -sL https://get.keptn.sh | bash\\n```\\n\\nAnd install Keptn using Helm:\\n```console\\nhelm repo add keptn https://charts.keptn.sh && helm repo update\\nhelm install keptn keptn/keptn \\\\\\n-n keptn --create-namespace \\\\\\n--wait \\\\\\n--set=apiGatewayNginx.type=LoadBalancer\\n```\\n\\nIn case you want to install `helm-service` and `jmeter-service`, execute:\\n\\n```console\\nhelm install jmeter-service keptn/jmeter-service -n keptn\\nhelm install helm-service keptn/helm-service -n keptn\\n```\\n\\nPlease follow the instructions printed by the CLI to connect to your Keptn installation.\\n\\n### Installing Keptn from Master branch\\n\\nNote: This will install a potentially unstable version of Keptn.\\n\\nIf you want to install the latest master version of Keptn onto your cluster you can do that by using the development helm charts repository located at https://charts-dev.keptn.sh .\\nBy default, the global registry used is ´ghcr.io/keptn´, so you will need to override it.\\n\\n```console\\nhelm repo add keptn-dev https://charts-dev.keptn.sh    # Add the keptn-dev helm repo\\nhelm repo update                                       # Update all repo contents\\nhelm search repo keptn-dev --devel --versions          # List all versions present in the keptn-dev repo\\n\\n# Select a chart version from the previous command that you want to install\\n\\nhelm install -n keptn-dev keptn keptn-dev/keptn --set=global.keptn.registry=ghcr.io/keptn --create-namespace --version \"<the-version-you-selected-previously>\"\\n```\\n\\nYou can find more information in our [docs](docs/).\\n\\n## Community\\n\\nPlease find details on regular hosted community events as well as our Slack workspace in the \\n[keptn/community repo](https://github.com/keptn/community).\\n\\n## Keptn Versions compatibilities\\n\\nWe manage the Keptn *core components* in versions.\\nThe versions of the Keptn *core components* and the services are compatible with each other. However, contributed services\\nas well as services that are not considered *core components* might not follow the same versioning schema.\\n\\nWe are tracking compatibility of those services [on our website](https://keptn.sh/docs/integrations/).\\n\\n## Container Images\\n\\nKeptn provides container images of all *core components*.\\nThe respective images in their versions are stored on the following container registries:\\n\\n* [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/keptn/packages?repo_name=keptn)\\n* [Quay.io Container Registry](https://quay.io/organization/keptn)\\n\\nFrom version 0.19.0, all released container images are signed using [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)\\nwith a keyless signing mechanism.\\nThat means that Keptn uses short-lived code signing certificates and keys together with OIDC and a transparency log\\nto sign all its container images.\\nMore info on keyless signed container images can be found [here](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/KEYLESS.md).\\n\\n\\n## Helm Chart\\n\\nKeptn provides Helm charts for easy installation of all control plane components.\\nFrom version 0.19.0, the charts are signed and can be verified with the public key that can be found in [assets/pubring.gpg](assets/pubring.gpg)\\nand attached to every release.\\nMore info on signed Helm charts can be found [here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/provenance/).\\n\\n## Contributions\\n\\nYou are welcome to contribute using Pull Requests to the respective repositories.

Please review the generated JSON files, which will appear as siblings to any of the markdown files in the `/specification` folder.\\n\\n### Style Guide\\n\\n- Use code blocks for examples.\\n  - Code blocks should be pseudocode, not any particular language, but should be vaguely \"Java-esque\".\\n- Use conditional requirements for requirements that only apply in particular situations, such as particular languages or runtimes.\\n- Use \"sentence case\" enclosed in ticks (\\\\`) when identifying entities outside of code blocks (ie: `evaluation details` instead of `EvaluationDetails`).\\n- Do not place line breaks into sentences, keep sentences to a single line for easier review.\\n- String literals appearing outside of code blocks should be enclosed in both ticks (\\\\`) and double-quotes (\") (ie: `\"PARSE_ERROR\"`).\\n- Use \"Title Case\" for all titles.\\n- Use the imperative mood and passive voice.\\n',\n",

       " \"K3s - Lightweight Kubernetes\\n===============================================\\n\\nLightweight Kubernetes.  Production ready, easy to install, half the memory, all in a binary less than 100 MB.\\n\\nGreat for:\\n\\n* Edge\\n* IoT\\n* CI\\n* Development\\n* ARM\\n* Embedding k8s\\n* Situations where a PhD in k8s clusterology is infeasible\\n\\nWhat is this?\\n---\\n\\nK3s is a [fully conformant](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/pulls?q=is%3Apr+k3s) production-ready Kubernetes distribution with the following changes:\\n\\n1. It is packaged as a single binary.\\n1. It adds support for sqlite3 as the default storage backend. Etcd3, MySQL, and Postgres are also supported.\\n1. It wraps Kubernetes and other components in a single, simple launcher.\\n1. It is secure by default with reasonable defaults for lightweight environments.\\n1. It has minimal to no OS dependencies (just a sane kernel and cgroup mounts needed).\\n1. It eliminates the need to expose a port on Kubernetes worker nodes for the kubelet API by exposing this API to the Kubernetes control plane nodes over a websocket tunnel.\\n\\nK3s bundles the following technologies together into a single cohesive distribution:\\n\\n* [Containerd](https://containerd.io/) & [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)\\n* [Flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel) for CNI\\n* [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/)\\n* [Metrics Server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server)\\n* [Traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/) for ingress\\n* [Klipper-lb](https://github.com/k3s-io/klipper-lb) as an embedded service load balancer provider\\n* [Kube-router](https://www.kube-router.io/) netpol controller for network policy\\n* [Helm-controller](https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller) to allow for CRD-driven deployment of helm manifests\\n* [Kine](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine) as a datastore shim that allows etcd to be replaced with other databases\\n* [Local-path-provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) for provisioning volumes using local storage\\n* [Host utilities](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-root) such as iptables/nftables, ebtables, ethtool, & socat\\n\\nThese technologies can be disabled or swapped out for technologies of your choice.\\n\\nAdditionally, K3s simplifies Kubernetes operations by maintaining functionality for:\\n\\n* Managing the TLS certificates of Kubernetes components\\n* Managing the connection between worker and server nodes\\n* Auto-deploying Kubernetes resources from local manifests in realtime as they are changed.\\n* Managing an embedded etcd cluster (work in progress)\\n\\nCurrent Status\\n--------------\\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/custom%2B25850%2Fgithub.com%2Fk3s-io%2Fk3s.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/custom%2B25850%2Fgithub.com%2Fk3s-io%2Fk3s?ref=badge_shield)\\n![Nightly CI](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/actions/workflows/nightly-install.yaml/badge.svg)\\n[![Build Status](https://drone-publish.k3s.io/api/badges/k3s-io/k3s/status.svg)](https://drone-publish.k3s.io/k3s-io/k3s)\\n[![Integration Test Coverage](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/actions/workflows/integration.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/actions/workflows/integration.yaml)\\n[![Unit Test Coverage](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/actions/workflows/unitcoverage.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/actions/workflows/unitcoverage.yaml)\\n\\nWhat's with the name?\\n--------------------\\n\\nWe wanted an installation of Kubernetes that was half the size in terms of memory footprint. Kubernetes is a\\n10 letter word stylized as k8s. So something half as big as Kubernetes would be a 5 letter word stylized as\\nK3s. There is neither a long-form of K3s nor official pronunciation.\\n\\nIs this a fork?\\n---------------\\n\\nNo, it's a distribution. A fork implies continued divergence from the original. This is not K3s's goal or practice. K3s explicitly intends not to change any core Kubernetes functionality. We seek to remain as close to upstream Kubernetes as possible. However, we maintain a small set of patches (well under 1000 lines) important to K3s's use case and deployment model. We maintain patches for other components as well. When possible, we contribute these changes back to the upstream projects, for example, with [SELinux support in containerd](https://github.com/containerd/cri/pull/1487/commits/24209b91bf361e131478d15cfea1ab05694dc3eb). This is a common practice amongst software distributions.\\n\\nK3s is a distribution because it packages additional components and services necessary for a fully functional cluster that go beyond vanilla Kubernetes. These are opinionated choices on technologies for components like ingress, storage class, network policy, service load balancer, and even container runtime. These choices and technologies are touched on in more detail in the [What is this?](#what-is-this) section.\\n\\nHow is this lightweight or smaller than upstream Kubernetes?\\n---\\n\\nThere are two major ways that K3s is lighter weight than upstream Kubernetes:\\n1. The memory footprint to run it is smaller\\n2. The binary, which contains all the non-containerized components needed to run a cluster, is smaller\\n\\nThe memory footprint is reduced primarily by running many components inside of a single process. This eliminates significant overhead that would otherwise be duplicated for each component.\\n\\nThe binary is smaller by removing third-party storage drivers and cloud providers, explained in more detail below.\\n\\nWhat have you removed from upstream Kubernetes?\\n---\\n\\nThis is a common point of confusion because it has changed over time. Early versions of K3s had much more removed than the current version. K3s currently removes two things:\\n\\n1. In-tree storage drivers\\n1. In-tree cloud provider\\n\\nBoth of these have out-of-tree alternatives in the form of [CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) and [CCM](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/running-cloud-controller/), which work in K3s and which upstream is moving towards.\\n\\nWe remove these to achieve a smaller binary size. They can be removed while remaining conformant because neither affects core Kubernetes functionality. They are also dependent on third-party cloud or data center technologies/services, which may not be available in many K3s' use cases.\\n\\nWhat's next?\\n---\\n\\nCheck out our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) to see what we have planned moving forward.\\n\\nRelease cadence\\n---\\n\\nK3s maintains pace with upstream Kubernetes releases. Our goal is to release patch releases within one week, and new minors within 30 days.\\n\\nOur release versioning reflects the version of upstream Kubernetes that is being released. For example, the K3s release [v1.18.6+k3s1](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/tag/v1.18.6%2Bk3s1) maps to the `v1.18.6` Kubernetes release. We add a postfix in the form of `+k3s<number>` to allow us to make additional releases using the same version of upstream Kubernetes while remaining [semver](https://semver.org/) compliant. For example, if we discovered a high severity bug in `v1.18.6+k3s1` and needed to release an immediate fix for it, we would release `v1.18.6+k3s2`.\\n\\nDocumentation\\n-------------\\n\\nPlease see [the official docs site](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/) for complete documentation.\\n\\nQuick-Start - Install Script\\n--------------\\n\\nThe `install.sh` script provides a convenient way to download K3s and add a service to systemd or openrc.\\n\\nTo install k3s as a service, run:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -\\n```\\n\\nA kubeconfig file is written to `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` and the service is automatically started or restarted.\\nThe install script will install K3s and additional utilities, such as `kubectl`, `crictl`, `k3s-killall.sh`, and `k3s-uninstall.sh`, for example:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo kubectl get nodes\\n```\\n\\n`K3S_TOKEN` is created at `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token` on your server.\\nTo install on worker nodes, pass `K3S_URL` along with\\n`K3S_TOKEN` environment variables, for example:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://myserver:6443 K3S_TOKEN=XXX sh -\\n```\\n\\nManual Download\\n---------------\\n\\n1. Download `k3s` from latest [release](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/releases/latest), x86_64, armhf, arm64 and s390x are supported.\\n1. Run the server.\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo k3s server &\\n# Kubeconfig is written to /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml\\nsudo k3s kubectl get nodes\\n\\n# On a different node run the below. NODE_TOKEN comes from\\n# /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token on your server\\nsudo k3s agent --server https://myserver:6443 --token ${NODE_TOKEN}\\n```\\n\\nContributing\\n------------\\n\\nPlease check out our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you're interested in contributing to K3s.\\n\\nSecurity\\n--------\\n\\nSecurity issues in K3s can be reported by sending an email to [security@k3s.io](mailto:security@k3s.io).\\nPlease do not file issues about security issues.\\n\",\n",

You can download the specified version. For example, specify the master development version to be installed\\ncurl -sfL https://oss.kubeclipper.io/get-kubeclipper.sh | KC_REGION=cn KC_VERSION=master bash -\\n```\\n\\n> It is highly recommended that you install the latest release to experience more features.  \\n> You can also download the specified version on the **[GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/kubeclipper/kubeclipper/releases)**.\\n\\nCheck if the installation is successful with the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nkcctl version\\n```\\n\\n#### Get Started with Installation\\n\\nIn this quick start tutorial, you only need to run  just one command for installation:\\n\\nIf you want to install AIO mode\\n\\n```bash\\n# install default release\\nkcctl deploy\\n# you can use KC_VERSION to install the specified version, default is latest release\\nKC_VERSION=master kcctl deploy\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to install multi node, Use `kcctl deploy -h` for more information about a command\\n\\nAfter you runn this command, kcctl will check your installation environment and enter the installation process, if the conditions are met.\\n\\nAfter printing the KubeClipper banner, the installation is complete.\\n\\n```bash\\n _   __      _          _____ _ _\\n| | / /     | |        /  __ \\\\ (_)\\n| |/ / _   _| |__   ___| /  \\\\/ |_ _ __  _ __   ___ _ __\\n|    \\\\| | | | \\'_ \\\\ / _ \\\\ |   | | | \\'_ \\\\| \\'_ \\\\ / _ \\\\ \\'__|\\n| |\\\\  \\\\ |_| | |_) |  __/ \\\\__/\\\\ | | |_) | |_) |  __/ |\\n\\\\_| \\\\_/\\\\__,_|_.__/ \\\\___|\\\\____/_|_| .__/| .__/ \\\\___|_|\\n                                 | |   | |\\n                                 |_|   |_|\\n```\\n\\n### Login Console\\n\\nWhen deployed successfully, you can open a browser and visit `http://$IP ` to enter the KubeClipper console.\\n\\n![](docs/img/console-login.png)\\n\\n You can log in with the default account and password `admin / Thinkbig1 `.\\n\\n> You may need to configure port forwarding rules and open ports in security groups for external users to access the console.\\n\\n### Create a k8s cluster\\n\\nWhen `kubeclipper` is deployed successfully, you can use the **kcctl** **tool** or **console** to create a  k8s cluster. In the quick start tutorial, we use the kcctl tool to create.\\n\\nFirst, log in with the default account and password to obtain the token, which is convenient for subsequent interaction between kcctl and kc-server.\\n\\n```bash\\n# if your kc-server node ip is 192.168.234.3\\n# you should replace 192.168.234.3 to your kc-server node ip\\nkcctl login -H http://192.168.234.3:8080  -u admin -p Thinkbig1\\n```\\n\\nThen create a k8s cluster with the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nNODE=$(kcctl get node -o yaml|grep ipv4DefaultIP:|sed \\'s/ipv4DefaultIP: //\\')\\n\\nkcctl create cluster --master $NODE --name demo --untaint-master\\n```\\n\\nThe cluster creation will be completed in about 3 minutes, or you can use the following command to view the cluster status:\\n\\n```bash\\nkcctl get cluster -o yaml|grep status -A5\\n```\\n\\n> You can also enter the console to view real-time logs.\\n\\nOnce the cluster enter  the `Running` state , it means that the creation is complete. You can use `kubectl get cs` command to view the cluster status.\\n\\n## Development and Debugging\\n\\n1. fork repo and clone\\n2. run etcd locally, usually use docker / podman to run etcd container\\n   ```bash\\n   export HostIP=\"Your-IP\"\\n   docker run -d \\\\\\n   --net host \\\\\\n   k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.5.0-0 etcd \\\\\\n   --advertise-client-urls http://${HostIP}:2379 \\\\\\n   --initial-advertise-peer-urls http://${HostIP}:2380 \\\\\\n   --initial-cluster=infra0=http://${HostIP}:2380 \\\\\\n   --listen-client-urls http://${HostIP}:2379,http://127.0.0.1:2379 \\\\\\n   --listen-metrics-urls http://127.0.0.1:2381 \\\\\\n   --listen-peer-urls http://${HostIP}:2380 \\\\\\n   --name infra0 \\\\\\n   --snapshot-count=10000 \\\\\\n   --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd\\n   ```\\n3. change `kubeclipper-server.yaml` etcd.serverList to your locally etcd cluster\\n4. `make build`\\n5. `./dist/kubeclipper-server serve`\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nPlease follow [Community](https://github.com/kubeclipper/community) to join us.\\n\\n## Star History\\n\\n![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=kubeclipper/kubeclipper&type=Date)\\n',\n",

Each building block is independent and you can use one, some, or all of them in your application.\\n\\n![Dapr overview](./img/overview.png)\\n\\nWe are a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) incubation project.\\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kedacore/keda/main/images/logo-cncf.svg\" height=\"75px\"></p>\\n\\n## Goals\\n\\n- Enable developers using *any* language or framework to write distributed applications\\n- Solve the hard problems developers face building microservice applications by providing best practice building blocks\\n- Be community driven, open and vendor neutral\\n- Gain new contributors\\n- Provide consistency and portability through open APIs\\n- Be platform agnostic across cloud and edge\\n- Embrace extensibility and provide pluggable components without vendor lock-in\\n- Enable IoT and edge scenarios by being highly performant and lightweight\\n- Be incrementally adoptable from existing code, with no runtime dependency\\n\\n## How it works\\n\\nDapr injects a side-car (container or process) to each compute unit. The side-car interacts with event triggers and communicates with the compute unit via standard HTTP or gRPC protocols. This enables Dapr to support all existing and future programming languages without requiring you to import frameworks or libraries.\\n\\nDapr offers built-in state management, reliable messaging (at least once delivery), triggers and bindings through standard HTTP verbs or gRPC interfaces. This allows you to write stateless, stateful and actor-like services following the same programming paradigm. You can freely choose consistency model, threading model and message delivery patterns.\\n\\nDapr runs natively on Kubernetes, as a self hosted binary on your machine, on an IoT device, or as a container that can be injected into any system, in the cloud or on-premises.\\n\\nDapr uses pluggable component state stores and message buses such as Redis as well as gRPC to offer a wide range of communication methods, including direct dapr-to-dapr using gRPC and async Pub-Sub with guaranteed delivery and at-least-once semantics.\\n\\n\\n## Why Dapr?\\n\\nWriting highly performant, scalable and reliable distributed application is hard. Dapr brings proven patterns and practices to you. It unifies event-driven and actors semantics into a simple, consistent programming model. It supports all programming languages without framework lock-in. You are not exposed to low-level primitives such as threading, concurrency control, partitioning and scaling. Instead, you can write your code by implementing a simple web server using familiar web frameworks of your choice.\\n\\nDapr is flexible in threading and state consistency models. You can leverage multi-threading if you choose to, and you can choose among different consistency models. This flexibility enables you to implement advanced scenarios without artificial constraints. Dapr is unique because you can transition seamlessly between platforms and underlying implementations without rewriting your code.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n* Event-driven Pub-Sub system with pluggable providers and at-least-once semantics\\n* Input and output bindings with pluggable providers\\n* State management with pluggable data stores\\n* Consistent service-to-service discovery and invocation\\n* Opt-in stateful models: Strong/Eventual consistency, First-write/Last-write wins\\n* Cross platform virtual actors\\n* Secret management to retrieve secrets from secure key vaults\\n* Rate limiting\\n* Built-in [Observability](https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/observability-concept/) support\\n* Runs natively on Kubernetes using a dedicated Operator and CRDs\\n* Supports all programming languages via HTTP and gRPC\\n* Multi-Cloud, open components (bindings, pub-sub, state) from Azure, AWS, GCP\\n* Runs anywhere, as a process or containerized\\n* Lightweight (58MB binary, 4MB physical memory)\\n* Runs as a sidecar - removes the need for special SDKs or libraries\\n* Dedicated CLI - developer friendly experience with easy debugging\\n* Clients for Java, .NET Core, Go, Javascript, Python, Rust and C++\\n\\n## Get Started using Dapr\\n\\nSee our [Getting Started](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/) guide over in our docs.\\n\\n## Quickstarts and Samples\\n\\n* See the [quickstarts repository](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts) for code examples that can help you get started with Dapr.\\n* Explore additional samples in the Dapr [samples repository](https://github.com/dapr/samples).\\n\\n## Community\\nWe want your contributions and suggestions!

Join our slack channel named, virtual-kubelet, within the [Kubernetes slack group](https://kubernetes.slack.com/).\\n\\nThe best description is \"Kubernetes API on top, programmable back.\"\\n\\n#### Table of Contents\\n\\n* [How It Works](#how-it-works)\\n* [Usage](#usage)\\n* [Providers](#providers)\\n    + [Admiralty Multi-Cluster Scheduler](#admiralty-multi-cluster-scheduler)\\n    + [Alibaba Cloud ECI Provider](#alibaba-cloud-eci-provider)\\n    + [Azure Container Instances Provider](#azure-container-instances-provider)\\n\\t+ [Azure Batch GPU Provider](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/azure-batch/blob/master/README.md)\\n    + [AWS Fargate Provider](#aws-fargate-provider)\\n    + [Elotl Kip](#elotl-kip)\\n\\t+ [HashiCorp Nomad](#hashicorp-nomad-provider)\\n    + [Liqo](#liqo-provider)\\n    + [OpenStack Zun](#openstack-zun-provider)\\n    + [Tensile Kube Provider](#tensile-kube-provider)\\n    + [Adding a New Provider via the Provider Interface](#adding-a-new-provider-via-the-provider-interface)\\n* [Testing](#testing)\\n    + [Unit tests](#unit-tests)\\n    + [End-to-end tests](#end-to-end-tests)\\n* [Known quirks and workarounds](#known-quirks-and-workarounds)\\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\\n\\n## How It Works\\n\\nThe diagram below illustrates how Virtual-Kubelet works.\\n\\n![diagram](website/static/img/diagram.svg)\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nVirtual Kubelet is focused on providing a library that you can consume in your\\nproject to build a custom Kubernetes node agent.\\n\\nSee godoc for up to date instructions on consuming this project:\\nhttps://godoc.org/github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet\\n\\nThere are implementations available for [several providers](#providers), see\\nthose repos for details on how to deploy.\\n\\n## Current Features\\n\\n- create, delete and update pods\\n- container logs, exec, and metrics\\n- get pod, pods and pod status\\n- capacity\\n- node addresses, node capacity, node daemon endpoints\\n- operating system\\n- bring your own virtual network\\n\\n\\n## Providers\\n\\nThis project features a pluggable provider interface developers can implement\\nthat defines the actions of a typical kubelet.\\n\\nThis enables on-demand and nearly instantaneous container compute, orchestrated\\nby Kubernetes, without having VM infrastructure to manage and while still\\nleveraging the portable Kubernetes API.\\n\\nEach provider may have its own configuration file, and required environmental variables.\\n\\nProviders must provide the following functionality to be considered a supported integration with Virtual Kubelet.\\n1. Provides the back-end plumbing necessary to support the lifecycle management of pods, containers and supporting resources in the context of Kubernetes.\\n2. Conforms to the current API provided by Virtual Kubelet.\\n3. Does not have access to the Kubernetes API Server and has a well-defined callback mechanism for getting data like secrets or configmaps.\\n\\n### Admiralty Multi-Cluster Scheduler\\n\\nAdmiralty Multi-Cluster Scheduler mutates annotated pods into \"proxy pods\" scheduled on a virtual-kubelet node and creates corresponding \"delegate pods\" in remote clusters (actually running the containers). A feedback loop updates the statuses and annotations of the proxy pods to reflect the statuses and annotations of the delegate pods. You can find more details in the [Admiralty Multi-Cluster Scheduler documentation](https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler).\\n\\n### Alibaba Cloud ECI Provider\\n\\nAlibaba Cloud ECI(Elastic Container Instance) is a service that allow you run containers without having to manage servers or clusters.\\n\\nYou can find more details in the [Alibaba Cloud ECI provider documentation](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/alibabacloud-eci/blob/master/README.md).\\n\\n#### Configuration File\\n\\nThe alibaba ECI provider will read configuration file specified by the `--provider-config` flag.\\n\\nThe example configure file is in the [ECI provider repository](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/alibabacloud-eci/blob/master/eci.toml).\\n\\n### Azure Container Instances Provider\\n\\nThe Azure Container Instances Provider allows you to utilize both\\ntypical pods on VMs and Azure Container instances simultaneously in the\\nsame Kubernetes cluster.\\n\\nYou can find detailed instructions on how to set it up and how to test it in the [Azure Container Instances Provider documentation](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/azure-aci/blob/master/README.md).\\n\\n#### Configuration File\\n\\nThe Azure connector can use a configuration file specified by the `--provider-config` flag.\\nThe config file is in TOML format, and an example lives in `providers/azure/example.toml`.\\n\\n### AWS Fargate Provider\\n\\n[AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) is a technology that allows you to run containers\\nwithout having to manage servers or clusters.\\n\\nThe AWS Fargate provider allows you to deploy pods to [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/).\\nYour pods on AWS Fargate have access to VPC networking with dedicated ENIs in your subnets, public\\nIP addresses to connect to the internet, private IP addresses to connect to your Kubernetes cluster,\\nsecurity groups, IAM roles, CloudWatch Logs and many other AWS services. Pods on Fargate can\\nco-exist with pods on regular worker nodes in the same Kubernetes cluster.\\n\\nEasy instructions and a sample configuration file is available in the [AWS Fargate provider documentation](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/aws-fargate). Please note that this provider is not currently supported. \\n\\n### Elotl Kip\\n\\n[Kip](https://github.com/elotl/kip) is a provider that runs pods in cloud instances, allowing a Kubernetes cluster to transparently scale workloads into a cloud. When a pod is scheduled onto the virtual node, Kip starts a right-sized cloud instance for the pod\\'s workload and dispatches the pod onto the instance. When the pod is finished running, the cloud instance is terminated.\\n\\nWhen workloads run on Kip, your cluster size naturally scales with the cluster workload, pods are strongly isolated from each other and the user is freed from managing worker nodes and strategically packing pods onto nodes.\\n\\n### HashiCorp Nomad Provider\\n\\nHashiCorp [Nomad](https://nomadproject.io) provider for Virtual Kubelet connects your Kubernetes cluster\\nwith Nomad cluster by exposing the Nomad cluster as a node in Kubernetes. By\\nusing the provider, pods that are scheduled on the virtual Nomad node\\nregistered on Kubernetes will run as jobs on Nomad clients as they\\nwould on a Kubernetes node.\\n\\nFor detailed instructions, follow the guide [here](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/nomad/blob/master/README.md).\\n\\n### Liqo Provider\\n\\n[Liqo](https://liqo.io) implements a provider for Virtual Kubelet designed to transparently offload pods and services to \"peered\" Kubernetes remote cluster. Liqo is capable of discovering neighbor clusters (using DNS, mDNS) and \"peer\" with them, or in other words, establish a relationship to share part of the cluster resources. When a cluster has established a peering, a new instance of the Liqo Virtual Kubelet is spawned to seamlessly extend the capacity of the cluster, by providing an abstraction of the resources of the remote cluster. The provider combined with the Liqo network fabric extends the cluster networking by enabling Pod-to-Pod traffic and multi-cluster east-west services, supporting endpoints on both clusters.\\n\\nFor detailed instruction, follow the guide [here](https://github.com/liqotech/liqo/blob/master/README.md)\\n\\n### OpenStack Zun Provider\\n\\nOpenStack [Zun](https://docs.openstack.org/zun/latest/) provider for Virtual Kubelet connects\\nyour Kubernetes cluster with OpenStack in order to run Kubernetes pods on OpenStack Cloud.\\nYour pods on OpenStack have access to OpenStack tenant networks because they have Neutron ports\\nin your subnets. Each pod will have private IP addresses to connect to other OpenStack resources\\n(i.e. VMs) within your tenant, optionally have floating IP addresses to connect to the internet,\\nand bind-mount Cinder volumes into a path inside a pod\\'s container.\\n\\n```bash\\n./bin/virtual-kubelet --provider=\"openstack\"\\n```\\n\\nFor detailed instructions, follow the guide [here](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/openstack-zun/blob/master/README.md).\\n\\n### Tensile Kube Provider\\n\\n[Tensile kube](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/tensile-kube/blob/master/README.md) is contributed by [tencent\\n games](https://game.qq.com), which is provider for Virtual Kubelet connects your Kubernetes cluster with other Kubernetes clusters. This provider enables us extending Kubernetes to an unlimited one. By using the provider, pods that are scheduled on the virtual node registered on Kubernetes will run as jobs on other Kubernetes clusters\\' nodes.\\n\\n### Adding a New Provider via the Provider Interface\\n\\nProviders consume this project as a library which implements the core logic of\\na Kubernetes node agent (Kubelet), and wire up their implementation for\\nperforming the neccessary actions.\\n\\nThere are 3 main interfaces:\\n\\n#### PodLifecycleHandler\\n\\nWhen pods are created, updated, or deleted from Kubernetes, these methods are\\ncalled to handle those actions.\\n\\n[godoc#PodLifecylceHandler](https://godoc.org/github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet/node#PodLifecycleHandler)\\n\\n```go\\ntype PodLifecycleHandler interface {\\n    // CreatePod takes a Kubernetes Pod and deploys it within the provider.\\n    CreatePod(ctx context.Context, pod *corev1.Pod) error\\n\\n    // UpdatePod takes a Kubernetes Pod and updates it within the provider.\\n    UpdatePod(ctx context.Context, pod *corev1.Pod) error\\n\\n    // DeletePod takes a Kubernetes Pod and deletes it from the provider.\\n    DeletePod(ctx context.Context, pod *corev1.Pod) error\\n\\n    // GetPod retrieves a pod by name from the provider (can be cached).\\n    GetPod(ctx context.Context, namespace, name string) (*corev1.Pod, error)\\n\\n    // GetPodStatus retrieves the status of a pod by name from the provider.\\n    GetPodStatus(ctx context.Context, namespace, name string) (*corev1.PodStatus, error)\\n\\n    // GetPods retrieves a list of all pods running on the provider (can be cached).\\n    GetPods(context.Context) ([]*corev1.Pod, error)\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThere is also an optional interface `PodNotifier` which enables the provider to\\nasynchronously notify the virtual-kubelet about pod status changes. If this\\ninterface is not implemented, virtual-kubelet will periodically check the status\\nof all pods.\\n\\nIt is highly recommended to implement `PodNotifier`, especially if you plan\\nto run a large number of pods.\\n\\n[godoc#PodNotifier](https://godoc.org/github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet/node#PodNotifier)\\n\\n```go\\ntype PodNotifier interface {\\n    // NotifyPods instructs the notifier to call the passed in function when\\n    // the pod status changes.\\n    //\\n    // NotifyPods should not block callers.\\n    NotifyPods(context.Context, func(*corev1.Pod))\\n}\\n```\\n\\n`PodLifecycleHandler` is consumed by the `PodController` which is the core\\nlogic for managing pods assigned to the node.\\n\\n```go\\n\\tpc, _ := node.NewPodController(podControllerConfig) // <-- instatiates the pod controller\\n\\tpc.Run(ctx) // <-- starts watching for pods to be scheduled on the node\\n```\\n\\n#### NodeProvider\\n\\nNodeProvider is responsible for notifying the virtual-kubelet about node status\\nupdates. Virtual-Kubelet will periodically check the status of the node and\\nupdate Kubernetes accordingly.\\n\\n[godoc#NodeProvider](https://godoc.org/github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet/node#NodeProvider)\\n\\n```go\\ntype NodeProvider interface {\\n    // Ping checks if the node is still active.\\n    // This is intended to be lightweight as it will be called periodically as a\\n    // heartbeat to keep the node marked as ready in Kubernetes.\\n    Ping(context.Context) error\\n\\n    // NotifyNodeStatus is used to asynchronously monitor the node.\\n    // The passed in callback should be called any time there is a change to the\\n    // node\\'s status.\\n    // This will generally trigger a call to the Kubernetes API server to update\\n    // the status.\\n    //\\n    // NotifyNodeStatus should not block callers.\\n    NotifyNodeStatus(ctx context.Context, cb func(*corev1.Node))\\n}\\n```\\n\\nVirtual Kubelet provides a `NaiveNodeProvider` that you can use if you do not\\nplan to have custom node behavior.\\n\\n[godoc#NaiveNodeProvider](https://godoc.org/github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet/node#NaiveNodeProvider)\\n\\n`NodeProvider` gets consumed by the `NodeController`, which is core logic for\\nmanaging the node object in Kubernetes.\\n\\n```go\\n\\tnc, _ := node.NewNodeController(nodeProvider, nodeSpec) // <-- instantiate a node controller from a node provider and a kubernetes node spec\\n\\tnc.Run(ctx) // <-- creates the node in kubernetes and starts up he controller\\n```\\n\\n#### API endpoints\\n\\nOne of the roles of a Kubelet is to accept requests from the API server for\\nthings like `kubectl logs` and  `kubectl exec`. Helpers for setting this up are\\nprovided [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet/node/api)\\n\\n#### Scrape Pod metrics\\n\\nIf you want to use HPA(Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) in your cluster, the provider should implement the `GetStatsSummary` function. Then metrics-server will be able to get the metrics of the pods on virtual-kubelet. Otherwise, you may see `No metrics for pod ` on metrics-server, which means the metrics of the pods on virtual-kubelet are not collected.\\n\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\n### Unit tests\\n\\nRunning the unit tests locally is as simple as `make test`.\\n\\n### End-to-end tests\\n\\nCheck out [`test/e2e`](./test/e2e) for more details.\\n\\n## Known quirks and workarounds\\n\\n### Missing Load Balancer IP addresses for services\\n\\n#### Providers that do not support service discovery\\n\\nKubernetes 1.9 introduces a new flag, `ServiceNodeExclusion`, for the control plane\\'s Controller Manager. Enabling this flag in the Controller Manager\\'s manifest allows Kubernetes to exclude Virtual Kubelet nodes from being added to Load Balancer pools, allowing you to create public facing services with external IPs without issue.\\n\\n#### Workaround\\n\\nCluster requirements: Kubernetes 1.9 or above\\n\\nEnable the ServiceNodeExclusion flag, by modifying the Controller Manager manifest and adding `--feature-gates=ServiceNodeExclusion=true` to the command line arguments.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nVirtual Kubelet follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).\\nSign the [CNCF CLA](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md) to be able to make Pull Requests to this repo.\\n\\nMonthly Virtual Kubelet Office Hours are held at 10am PST on the second Thursday of every month in this [zoom meeting room](https://zoom.us/j/94701509915).

This enables you to send the metrics from multiple Prometheus servers to a single Cortex cluster and run \"globally aggregated\" queries across all data in a single place.\\n- **Highly available:** When run in a cluster, Cortex can replicate data between machines. This allows you to survive machine failure without gaps in your graphs.\\n- **Multi-tenant:** Cortex can isolate data and queries from multiple different independent\\nPrometheus sources in a single cluster, allowing untrusted parties to share the same cluster.\\n- **Long term storage:** Cortex supports S3, GCS, Swift and Microsoft Azure for long term storage of metric data. This allows you to durably store data for longer than the lifetime of any single machine, and use this data for long term capacity planning.\\n\\nCortex is a [CNCF](https://cncf.io) incubation project used in several production systems including [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP)](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/).\\n\\nCortex is primarily used as a [remote write](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/configuration/#remote_write) destination for Prometheus, with a Prometheus-compatible query API.\\n\\n\\n## Chunk Storage Deprecation Notice\\n\\nThe chunks storage is deprecated since v1.10.0. You\\'re encouraged to use the [blocks storage](docs/blocks-storage/_index.md).\\n\\nChunks storage was removed in release 1.14.0\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nRead the [getting started guide](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/getting-started) if you\\'re new to the\\nproject. Before deploying Cortex with a permanent storage backend you\\nshould read:\\n1. [An overview of Cortex\\'s architecture](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/architecture/)\\n1. [Getting started with Cortex](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/getting-started/)\\n1. [Information regarding configuring Cortex](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/configuration/)\\n\\nThere are also individual [guides](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/guides/) to many tasks.\\nPlease review

The ingraind agent uses eBPF\\nprobes to provide safe and performant instrumentation for any Linux-based environment.\\n\\nInGrain provides oversight of assets and risks:\\n * Your customer data - an employee copying your customer database to their\\n   personal cloud store.\\n * Your infrastructure - an attacker executing a zero day attack to gain access\\n   to your web servers.\\n * Your resources - malware using your users machines compute resources to mine\\n   cryptocurrency.\\n\\nThis is what `curl https://redsift.com` looks like if seen through ingraind:\\n\\n![ingrain listening to DNS & TLS](./screencast.gif)\\n\\n## Requirements\\n\\n * LLVM/Clang version 9 or newer\\n * Rust toolchain [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)\\n * Linux 4.15 kernel or newer including kernel headers\\n * capnproto\\n\\n## Compile\\n\\nThe usual Rust compilation ritual will produce a binary in `target/release`:\\n\\n    $ cargo build --release\\n\\nor for a kernel version other than the running one:\\n\\n    $ export KERNEL_VERSION=1.2.3\\n\\t$ cargo build --release\\n\\nor with a custom kernel tree path (needs to include generated files):\\n\\n    $ export KERNEL_SOURCE=/build/linux\\n\\t$ cargo build --release\\n\\t\\nWe keep `ingraind` compatible with the `musl` target on `x86_64`,\\nwhich you can build like so:\\n\\n\\t$ cargo build --release --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl\\n\\n## Build a docker image\\n\\nTo build a Docker image, use the instructions above to build an\\ningrain binary for the desired kernel.

Gadget is deployed to each node as a privileged DaemonSet.\\nIt uses in-kernel eBPF helper programs to monitor events mainly related to\\nsyscalls from userspace programs in a pod. The eBPF programs are run by\\nthe kernel and gather the log data. Inspektor Gadget\\'s userspace\\nutilities fetch the log data from ring buffers and display it. What eBPF\\nprograms are and how Inspektor Gadget uses them is briefly explained in\\nthe [architecture](docs/architecture.md) document.\\n\\n## `ig`\\n\\nInspektor Gadget can also be used without Kubernetes to trace containers with\\nthe [`ig`](docs/ig.md) tool.\\n\\n## Kernel requirements\\n\\nThe different gadgets shipped with Inspektor Gadget use a variety of eBPF\\ncapabilities. The capabilities available depend on the version and\\nconfiguration of the kernel running in the node.

Automatically creates metrics for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).  Includes simple JSON status page.  **Now part of the CNCF!**\\n\\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)\\n[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy)\\n[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/2822/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/2822)\\n[![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/kuberhealthy.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/kuberhealthy)  \\n[![Join Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-kubernetes/kuberhealthy-teal.svg?logo=slack)](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/CB9G7HWTE)\\n\\n## What is Kuberhealthy?\\n\\nKuberhealthy lets you continuously verify that your applications and Kubernetes clusters are working as expected. By creating a custom resource (a [`KuberhealthyCheck`](hhttps://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/docs/CHECKS.md#khcheck-anatomy)) in your cluster, you can easily enable [various synthetic tests](docs/CHECKS_REGISTRY.md) and get Prometheus metrics for them.\\n\\nKuberhealthy comes with [lots of useful checks already available](docs/CHECKS_REGISTRY.md) to ensure the core functionality of Kubernetes, but checks can be used to test anything you like.  We encourage you to [write your own check container](docs/CHECK_CREATION.md) in any language to test your own applications.  It really is quick and easy!\\n\\nKuberhealthy serves the status of all checks on a simple JSON status page, a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics endpoint (at `/metrics`), and supports InfluxDB metric forwarding for integration into your choice of alerting solution.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\n\\n### Deployment\\n\\nKuberhealthy requires Kubernetes 1.16 or above.  \\n\\n#### Using Plain Ole\\' YAML\\n\\nIf you just want the rendered default specs without Helm, you can [use the static flat file](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/deploy/kuberhealthy.yaml) or the [static flat file for Prometheus](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/deploy/kuberhealthy-prometheus.yaml) or even the [static flat file for Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/deploy/kuberhealthy-prometheus-operator.yaml).\\n\\nHere are the one-line installation commands for those same specs:\\n```sh\\n# If you don\\'t use Prometheus:\\nkubectl create namespace kuberhealthy\\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/master/deploy/kuberhealthy.yaml\\n\\n# If you use Prometheus, but not with Prometheus Operator:\\nkubectl create namespace kuberhealthy\\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/master/deploy/kuberhealthy-prometheus.yaml\\n\\n# If you use Prometheus Operator:\\nkubectl create namespace kuberhealthy\\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/master/deploy/kuberhealthy-prometheus-operator.yaml\\n```\\n\\n#### Using Helm\\n\\n```sh\\nkubectl create namespace kuberhealthy\\nhelm repo add kuberhealthy https://kuberhealthy.github.io/kuberhealthy/helm-repos\\nhelm install -n kuberhealthy kuberhealthy kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy\\n```\\n\\nIf you have Prometheus\\n\\n```\\nhelm install --set prometheus.enabled=true -n kuberhealthy kuberhealthy kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy\\n```\\n\\nIf you have Prometheus via Prometheus Operator:\\n\\n```\\nhelm install --set prometheus.enabled=true --set prometheus.serviceMonitor.enabled=true -n kuberhealthy kuberhealthy kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy\\n```\\n\\n#### Configure Service\\n\\nAfter installation, Kuberhealthy will only be available from within the cluster (`Type: ClusterIP`) at the service URL `kuberhealthy.kuberhealthy`.  To expose Kuberhealthy to clients outside of the cluster, you **must** edit the service `kuberhealthy` and set `Type: LoadBalancer` or otherwise expose the service yourself.\\n\\n\\n#### Edit Configuration Settings\\n\\nYou can edit the Kuberhealthy configmap as well and it will be automatically reloaded by Kuberhealthy.  All configmap options are set to their defaults to make configuration easy.\\n\\n`kubectl edit -n kuberhealthy configmap kuberhealthy`\\n\\n#### See Configured Checks\\n\\nYou can see checks that are configured with `kubectl -n kuberhealthy get khcheck`.  Check status can be accessed by the JSON status page endpoint, or via `kubectl -n kuberhealthy get khstate`.\\n\\n\\n### Further Configuration\\n\\n\\nTo configure Kuberhealthy after installation, see the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md).\\n\\nDetails on using the helm chart are [documented here](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/tree/master/deploy/helm/kuberhealthy).  The Helm installation of Kuberhealthy is automatically updated to use the latest [Kuberhealthy release](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/releases).\\n\\nMore installation options, including static yaml files are available in the [/deploy](/deploy) directory. These flat spec files contain the most recent changes to Kuberhealthy, or the master branch. Use this if you would like to test master branch updates.\\n\\n## Visualized\\n\\nHere is an illustration of how Kuberhealthy provisions and operates checker pods.  The following process is illustrated:\\n\\n- An admin creates a [`KuberhealthyCheck`](hhttps://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/docs/CHECKS.md#khcheck-anatomy) resource that calls for a synthetic Kubernetes daemonset to be deployed and tested every 15 minutes.  This will ensure that all nodes in the Kubernetes cluster can provision containers properly.\\n- Kuberhealthy observes this new `KuberhealthyCheck` resource.\\n- Kuberhealthy schedules a checker pod to manage the lifecycle of this check.\\n- The checker pod creates a daemonset using the Kubernetes API.\\n- The checker pod observes the daemonset and waits for all daemonset pods to become `Ready`\\n- The checker pod deletes the daemonset using the Kubernetes API.\\n- The checker pod observes the daemonset being fully cleaned up and removed.\\n- The checker pod reports a successful test result back to Kuberhealthy\\'s API.\\n- Kuberhealthy stores this check\\'s state and makes it available to various metrics systems.\\n\\n\\n<img src=\"images/kh-ds-check.gif\">\\n\\n## Included Checks\\n\\nYou can use any of [the pre-made checks](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/docs/CHECKS_REGISTRY.md#khcheck-registry) by simply enabling them.  By default Kuberhealthy comes with several checks to test Kubernetes deployments, daemonsets, and DNS.\\n\\n#### Some checks you can easily enable:\\n\\n- [SSL Handshake Check](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/cmd/ssl-handshake-check/README.md) - checks SSL certificate validity and warns when certs are about to expire.\\n- [CronJob Scheduling Failures](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/cmd/cronjob-checker/README.md) - checks for events indicating that a CronJob has failed to create Job pods.\\n- [Image Pull Check](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/cmd/test-check#image-pull-check) - checks that an image can be pulled from an image repository.\\n- [Deployment Check](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/cmd/deployment-check/README.md) - verifies that a fresh deployment can run, deploy multiple pods, pass traffic, do a rolling update (without dropping connections), and clean up successfully.\\n- [Daemonset Check](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/blob/master/cmd/daemonset-check/README.md) - verifies that a daemonset can be created, fully provisioned, and torn down.  This checks the full kubelet functionality of every node in your Kubernetes cluster.\\n- [Storage Provisioner Check](https://github.com/ChrisHirsch/kuberhealthy-storage-check) - verifies that a pod with persistent storage can be configured on every node in your cluster.\\n\\n\\n## Create Synthetic Checks for Your APIs\\n\\nYou can easily create synthetic tests to check your applications and APIs with real world use cases. This is a great way to be confident that your application functions as expected in the real world at all times.\\n\\nHere is a full check example written in `go`.  Just implement `doCheckStuff` and you\\'re off!\\n\\n\\n```go\\npackage main\\n\\nimport (\\n  \"github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/v2/pkg/checks/external/checkclient\"\\n)\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n  ok := doCheckStuff()\\n  if !ok {\\n    checkclient.ReportFailure([]string{\"Test has failed!\"})\\n    return\\n  }\\n  checkclient.ReportSuccess()\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nYou can read more about [how checks are configured](docs/CHECKS.md) and [learn how to create your own check container](docs/CHECK_CREATION.md). Checks can be written in any language and helpful clients for checks not written in Go can be found in the [clients directory](/clients).\\n\\n### Status Page\\n\\nYou can directly access the current test statuses by accessing the `kuberhealthy.kuberhealthy` HTTP service on port 80.  The status page displays server status in the format shown below.  The boolean `OK` field can be used to indicate global up/down status, while the `Errors` array will contain a list of all check error descriptions.  Granular, per-check information, including how long the check took to run (Run Duration), the last time a check was run, and the Kuberhealthy pod ran that specific check is available under the `CheckDetails` object.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \"OK\": true,\\n    \"Errors\": [],\\n    \"CheckDetails\": {\\n        \"kuberhealthy/daemonset\": {\\n            \"OK\": true,\\n            \"Errors\": [],\\n            \"RunDuration\": \"22.512278967s\",\\n            \"Namespace\": \"kuberhealthy\",\\n            \"LastRun\": \"2019-11-14T23:24:16.7718171Z\",\\n            \"AuthoritativePod\": \"kuberhealthy-67bf8c4686-mbl2j\",\\n            \"uuid\": \"9abd3ec0-b82f-44f0-b8a7-fa6709f759cd\"\\n        },\\n        \"kuberhealthy/deployment\": {\\n            \"OK\": true,\\n            \"Errors\": [],\\n            \"RunDuration\": \"29.142295647s\",\\n            \"Namespace\": \"kuberhealthy\",\\n            \"LastRun\": \"2019-11-14T23:26:40.7444659Z\",\\n            \"AuthoritativePod\": \"kuberhealthy-67bf8c4686-mbl2j\",\\n            \"uuid\": \"5f0d2765-60c9-47e8-b2c9-8bc6e61727b2\"\\n        },\\n        \"kuberhealthy/dns-status-internal\": {\\n            \"OK\": true,\\n            \"Errors\": [],\\n            \"RunDuration\": \"2.43940936s\",\\n            \"Namespace\": \"kuberhealthy\",\\n            \"LastRun\": \"2019-11-14T23:34:04.8927434Z\",\\n            \"AuthoritativePod\": \"kuberhealthy-67bf8c4686-mbl2j\",\\n            \"uuid\": \"c85f95cb-87e2-4ff5-b513-e02b3d25973a\"\\n        },\\n        \"kuberhealthy/pod-restarts\": {\\n            \"OK\": true,\\n            \"Errors\": [],\\n            \"RunDuration\": \"2.979083775s\",\\n            \"Namespace\": \"kuberhealthy\",\\n            \"LastRun\": \"2019-11-14T23:34:06.1938491Z\",\\n            \"AuthoritativePod\": \"kuberhealthy-67bf8c4686-mbl2j\",\\n            \"uuid\": \"a718b969-421c-47a8-a379-106d234ad9d8\"\\n        }\\n    },\\n    \"CurrentMaster\": \"kuberhealthy-7cf79bdc86-m78qr\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in contributing to this project:\\n- Check out the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n- If you use Kuberhealthy in a production environment, add yourself to the list of [Kuberhealthy adopters](docs/KUBERHEALTHY_ADOPTERS.md)!\\n- Check out [open issues](https://github.com/kuberhealthy/kuberhealthy/issues).

Use Pixie to view the high-level state of your cluster (service maps, cluster resources, application traffic) and also drill down into more detailed views (pod state, flame graphs, individual full-body application requests).\\n\\n## Why Pixie?\\n\\nThree features enable Pixie\\'s magical developer experience:\\n\\n- **Auto-telemetry:** Pixie uses eBPF to automatically collect telemetry data such as full-body requests, resource and network metrics, application profiles, and more. See the full list of data sources [here](https://docs.px.dev/about-pixie/data-sources/).\\n\\n- **In-Cluster Edge Compute:** Pixie collects, stores and queries all telemetry data locally in the cluster. Pixie uses less than 5% of cluster CPU and in most cases less than 2%.\\n\\n- **Scriptability:** [PxL](https://docs.px.dev/reference/pxl/), Pixie’s flexible Pythonic query language, can be used across Pixie’s UI, CLI, and client APIs.\\n\\n## Use Cases\\n\\n### Network Monitoring\\n\\n<img src=\".readme_assets/net_flow_graph.png\" alt=\"Network Flow Graph\" width=\"525\" align=\"right\">\\n\\n<br>\\n\\nUse Pixie to monitor your network, including:\\n\\n- The flow of network traffic within your cluster.\\n- The flow of DNS requests within your cluster.\\n- Individual full-body DNS requests and responses.\\n- A Map of TCP drops and TCP retransmits across your cluster.\\n\\n<br>\\n\\nFor more details, check out the [tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/network-monitoring/) or [watch](https://youtu.be/qIxzIPBhAUI) an overview.\\n\\n<br clear=\"all\">\\n\\n### Infrastructure Health\\n\\n<img src=\".readme_assets/nodes.png\" alt=\"Infrastructure Monitoring\" width=\"525\" align=\"right\">\\n\\n<br>\\n\\nMonitor your infrastructure alongside your network and application layer, including:\\n\\n- Resource usage by Pod, Node, Namespace.\\n- CPU flame graphs per Pod, Node.\\n\\n<br>\\n\\nFor more details, check out the [tutorial](https://docs.px.dev/tutorials/pixie-101/infra-health/) or [watch](https://youtu.be/2dFIpiBryu8) an overview.\\n\\n<br clear=\"all\">\\n\\n### Service Performance\\n\\n<img src=\".readme_assets/service.png\" alt=\"Service Performance\" width=\"525\" align=\"right\">\\n\\n<br>\\n\\nPixie automatically traces a [variety of protocols](https://docs.px.dev/about-pixie/data-sources/).

It collects metrics\\nfrom configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions,\\ndisplays the results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.\\n\\nThe features that distinguish Prometheus from other metrics and monitoring systems are:\\n\\n* A **multi-dimensional** data model (time series defined by metric name and set of key/value dimensions)\\n* PromQL, a **powerful and flexible query language** to leverage this dimensionality\\n* No dependency on distributed storage; **single server nodes are autonomous**\\n* An HTTP **pull model** for time series collection\\n* **Pushing time series** is supported via an intermediary gateway for batch jobs\\n* Targets are discovered via **service discovery** or **static configuration**\\n* Multiple modes of **graphing and dashboarding support**\\n* Support for hierarchical and horizontal **federation**\\n\\n## Architecture overview\\n\\n![Architecture overview](documentation/images/architecture.svg)\\n\\n## Install\\n\\nThere are various ways of installing Prometheus.\\n\\n### Precompiled binaries\\n\\nPrecompiled binaries for released versions are available in the\\n[*download* section](https://prometheus.io/download/)\\non [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io). Using the latest production release binary\\nis the recommended way of installing Prometheus.\\nSee the [Installing](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/install/)\\nchapter in the documentation for all the details.\\n\\n### Docker images\\n\\nDocker images are available on [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/).\\n\\nYou can launch a Prometheus container for trying it out with\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker run --name prometheus -d -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 prom/prometheus\\n```\\n\\nPrometheus will now be reachable at <http://localhost:9090/>.\\n\\n### Building from source\\n\\nTo build Prometheus from source code, You need:\\n\\n* Go [version 1.17 or greater](https://golang.org/doc/install).\\n* NodeJS [version 16 or greater](https://nodejs.org/).\\n* npm [version 7 or greater](https://www.npmjs.com/).\\n\\nStart by cloning the repository:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus.git\\ncd prometheus\\n```\\n\\nYou can use the `go` tool to build and install the `prometheus`\\nand `promtool` binaries into your `GOPATH`:\\n\\n```bash\\nGO111MODULE=on go install github.com/prometheus/prometheus/cmd/...\\nprometheus --config.file=your_config.yml\\n```\\n\\n*However*, when using `go install` to build Prometheus, Prometheus will expect to be able to\\nread its web assets from local filesystem directories under `web/ui/static` and\\n`web/ui/templates`. In order for these assets to be found, you will have to run Prometheus\\nfrom the root of the cloned repository. Note also that these directories do not include the\\nReact UI unless it has been built explicitly using `make assets` or `make build`.\\n\\nAn example of the above configuration file can be found [here.](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/documentation/examples/prometheus.yml)\\n\\nYou can also build using `make build`, which will compile in the web assets so that\\nPrometheus can be run from anywhere:\\n\\n```bash\\nmake build\\n./prometheus --config.file=your_config.yml\\n```\\n\\nThe Makefile provides several targets:\\n\\n* *build*: build the `prometheus` and `promtool` binaries (includes building and compiling in web assets)\\n* *test*: run the tests\\n* *test-short*: run the short tests\\n* *format*: format the source code\\n* *vet*: check the source code for common errors\\n* *assets*: build the React UI\\n\\n### Service discovery plugins\\n\\nPrometheus is bundled with many service discovery plugins.\\nWhen building Prometheus from source, you can edit the [plugins.yml](./plugins.yml)\\nfile to disable some service discoveries. The file is a yaml-formated list of go\\nimport path that will be built into the Prometheus binary.\\n\\nAfter you have changed the file, you\\nneed to run `make build` again.\\n\\nIf you are using another method to compile Prometheus, `make plugins` will\\ngenerate the plugins file accordingly.\\n\\nIf you add out-of-tree plugins, which we do not endorse at the moment,\\nadditional steps might be needed to adjust the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files. As\\nalways, be extra careful when loading third party code.\\n\\n### Building the Docker image\\n\\nThe `make docker` target is designed for use in our CI system.\\nYou can build a docker image locally with the following commands:\\n\\n```bash\\nmake promu\\npromu crossbuild -p linux/amd64\\nmake npm_licenses\\nmake common-docker-amd64\\n```\\n\\n## Using Prometheus as a Go Library\\n\\n### Remote Write\\n\\nWe are publishing our Remote Write protobuf independently at\\n[buf.build](https://buf.build/prometheus/prometheus/assets).\\n\\nYou can use that as a library:\\n\\n```shell\\ngo get go.buf.build/protocolbuffers/go/prometheus/prometheus\\n```\\n\\nThis is experimental.\\n\\n### Prometheus code base\\n\\nIn order to comply with [go mod](https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions) rules,\\nPrometheus release number do not exactly match Go module releases. For the\\nPrometheus v2.y.z releases, we are publishing equivalent v0.y.z tags.\\n\\nTherefore, a user that would want to use Prometheus v2.35.0 as a library could do:\\n\\n```shell\\ngo get github.com/prometheus/prometheus@v0.35.0\\n```\\n\\nThis solution makes it clear that we might break our internal Go APIs between\\nminor user-facing releases, as [breaking changes are allowed in major version\\nzero](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).\\n\\n## React UI Development\\n\\nFor more information on building, running, and developing on the React-based UI, see the React app\\'s [README.md](web/ui/README.md).\\n\\n## More information\\n\\n* Godoc documentation is available via [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/prometheus). Due to peculiarities of Go Modules, v2.x.y will be displayed as v0.x.y.\\n* See the [Community page](https://prometheus.io/community) for how to reach the Prometheus developers and users on various communication channels.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nRefer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\\n\\n## License\\n\\nApache License 2.0, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/LICENSE).\\n\\n[hub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/\\n[quay]: https://quay.io/repository/prometheus/prometheus\\n',\n",
       " '# Skooner - Kubernetes Dashboard\\n\\n**We are changing our name from k8dash to Skooner! Please bear with us as we update our documentation and codebase to reflect this change. If you previously installed k8dash, you will need to uninstall it from your cluster and install Skooner instead. For most cases this can be done by running the following `kubectl delete deployment,service k8dash`**\\n\\nSkooner is the easiest way to manage your Kubernetes cluster. Skooner is now a sandbox project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects)!\\n\\n- **Full cluster management**: Namespaces, Nodes, Pods, Replica Sets, Deployments, Storage, RBAC and more\\n- **Blazing fast and Always Live**: no need to refresh pages to see the latest cluster status\\n- **Quickly visualize cluster health at a glance**: Real time charts help quickly track down poorly performing resources\\n- **Easy CRUD and scaling**: plus inline API docs to easily understand what each field does\\n- **100% responsive** (runs on your phone/tablet)\\n- **Simple OpenID integration**: no special proxies required\\n- **Simple installation**: use the provided yaml resources to have skooner up and running in under 1 minute (no, seriously)\\n- **See Skooner in action**:<br>\\n  [![Skooner - Kubernetes Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skooner-k8s/skooner/master/docs/videoThumbnail.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-1jGAhAHAM \"Skooner - Kubernetes Dashboard\")\\n\\n<br>\\n\\n## Table of Contents\\n\\n- [Skooner - Kubernetes Dashboard](#skooner---kubernetes-dashboard)\\n  - [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\\n  - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\\n  - [Getting Started](#getting-started)\\n  - [kubectl proxy](#kubectl-proxy)\\n  - [Logging in](#logging-in)\\n    - [Service Account Token](#service-account-token)\\n    - [OIDC](#oidc)\\n    - [NodePort](#nodeport)\\n    - [Metrics](#metrics)\\n  - [Development](#development)\\n  - [Skooner Architecture](#skooner-architecture)\\n    - [Server](#server)\\n    - [Client](#client)\\n  - [License](#license)\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\n- A running Kubernetes cluster (e.g., [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)), with...\\n  - [metrics server](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server) installed (optional, but strongly recommended)\\n  - configuration for [OpenId Connect](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) authentication (optional)\\n\\n(Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nDeploy Skooner with something like the following...\\n\\nNOTE: never trust a file downloaded from the internet. Make sure to review the contents of [kubernetes-skooner.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skooner-k8s/skooner/master/kubernetes-skooner.yaml) before running the script below.\\n\\n```bash\\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skooner-k8s/skooner/master/kubernetes-skooner.yaml\\n```\\n\\nTo access skooner, you must make it publicly visible. If you have an ingress server setup, you can accomplish by adding a route like the following:\\n\\n```yaml\\nkind: Ingress\\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\\nmetadata:\\n  name: skooner\\n  namespace: kube-system\\nspec:\\n  rules:\\n    - host: skooner.example.com\\n      http:\\n        paths:\\n          - path: /\\n            backend:\\n              service:\\n                name: skooner\\n                port:\\n                  number: 80\\n            pathType: ImplementationSpecific\\n```\\n\\nNote: `networking.k8s.io/v1` Ingress is required for Kubernetes v1.22+; `extensions/v1beta1` Ingress is deprecated in v1.14+ and unavailable in v1.22+.\\n\\n(Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\\n\\n## kubectl proxy\\n\\nUnfortunately, `kubectl proxy` cannot be used to access Skooner. According to [this comment](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/38775#issuecomment-277915961), it seems that `kubectl proxy` strips the Authorization header when it proxies requests.\\n\\n> this is working as expected. \"proxying\" through the apiserver will not get you standard proxy behavior (preserving Authorization headers end-to-end), because the API is not being used as a standard proxy\\n\\n(Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\\n\\n## Logging in\\n\\nThere are multiple options for logging into the dashboard: [Service Account Token](#Service-Account-Token), [OIDC](#oidc), and [NodePort](#Nodeport).\\n\\n### Service Account Token\\n\\nThe first (and easiest) option is to create a dedicated service account. In the command line:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Create the service account in the current namespace (we assume default)\\nkubectl create serviceaccount skooner-sa\\n\\n# Give that service account root on the cluster\\nkubectl create clusterrolebinding skooner-sa --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=default:skooner-sa\\n\\n# For Kubernetes v1.21 or lower\\n# Find the secret that was created to hold the token for the SA\\nkubectl get secrets\\n\\n# Show the contents of the secret to extract the token\\nkubectl describe secret skooner-sa-token-xxxxx\\n\\n# For Kubernetes v1.22 or higher\\nkubectl create token skooner-sa\\n\\n```\\n\\nCopy the `token` value from the secret, and enter it into the login screen to access the dashboard.\\n\\n### OIDC\\n\\nSkooner makes using OpenId Connect for authentication easy. Assuming your cluster is configured to use OIDC, all you need to do is create a secret containing your credentials and apply [kubernetes-skooner-oidc.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skooner-k8s/skooner/master/kubernetes-skooner-oidc.yaml).\\n\\nTo learn more about configuring a cluster for OIDC, check out these great links\\n\\n- [Authenticating | Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens)\\n- [Kubernetes Day 2 Operations: AuthN/AuthZ with OIDC and a Little Help From Keycloak | by Bob Killen | Medium](https://medium.com/@mrbobbytables/kubernetes-day-2-operations-authn-authz-with-oidc-and-a-little-help-from-keycloak-de4ea1bdbbe)\\n- [kubectl with OpenID Connect. TL;DR | by Hidetake Iwata | Medium](https://medium.com/@int128/kubectl-with-openid-connect-43120b451672)\\n- [kubernetes configure oidc - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?q=kubernetes+configure+oidc)\\n\\nYou can deploy Skooner with OIDC support using something like the following script...\\n\\nNOTE: never trust a file downloaded from the internet. Make sure to review the contents of [kubernetes-skooner-oidc.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skooner-k8s/skooner/master/kubernetes-skooner-oidc.yaml) before running the script below.\\n\\n```bash\\nOIDC_URL=<put your endpoint url here... something like https://accounts.google.com>\\nOIDC_ID=<put your id here... something like blah-blah-blah.apps.googleusercontent.com>\\nOIDC_SECRET=<put your oidc secret here>\\n\\nkubectl create secret -n kube-system generic skooner \\\\\\n--from-literal=url=$OIDC_URL \\\\\\n--from-literal=id=$OIDC_ID \\\\\\n--from-literal=secret=$OIDC_SECRET\\n\\nkubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skooner-k8s/skooner/master/kubernetes-skooner-oidc.yaml\\n\\n```\\n\\nAdditionally, you can provide other OIDC options via these environment variables:\\n\\n- `OIDC_SCOPES`: The default value for this value is `openid email`, but additional scopes can also be added using something like `OIDC_SCOPES=\"openid email groups\"`\\n- `OIDC_METADATA`: Skooner uses the excellent [node-openid-client](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client) module. `OIDC_METADATA` will take a JSON string and pass it to the `Client` constructor. Docs [here](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client/blob/master/docs/README.md#client). For example, `OIDC_METADATA=\\'{\"token_endpoint_auth_method\":\"client_secret_post\"}`\\n\\n### NodePort\\n\\nIf you do not have an ingress server setup, you can utilize a NodePort service as configured in [kubernetes-skooner-nodeport.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skooner-k8s/skooner/master/kubernetes-skooner-nodeport.yaml). This is ideal when creating a single node master, or if you want to get up and running as fast as possible.\\n\\nThis will map Skooner port `4654` to a randomly selected port on the running node. The assigned port can be found using:\\n\\n```\\n$ kubectl get svc --namespace=kube-system\\n\\nNAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE\\nskooner     NodePort    10.107.107.62   <none>        4654:32565/TCP   1m\\n```\\n\\n### Metrics\\n\\nSkooner relies heavily on [metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server) to display real time cluster metrics. It is strongly recommended to have `metrics-server` installed to get the best experience from Skooner.\\n\\n- [Installing metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server)\\n- [Running metrics-server with kubeadm](https://medium.com/@waleedkhan91/how-to-configure-metrics-server-on-kubeadm-provisioned-kubernetes-cluster-f755a2ac43a2)\\n\\n(Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\\n\\n## Development\\n\\nYou will need:\\n\\n- A running Kubernetes cluster\\n  - Installing and running [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) is an easy way to get this.\\n  - Once minikube is installed, you can run it with the command `minikube start --driver=docker`\\n- Once the cluster is up and running, create some login credentials as described [above](#logging-in)\\n\\n(Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\\n\\n## Skooner Architecture\\n\\n### Server\\n\\nTo run the server, run `npm i` from the `/server` directory to install dependencies and then `npm start` to run the server.\\nThe server is a simple express.js server that is primarily responsible for proxying requests to the Kubernetes api server.\\n\\nDuring development, the server will use whatever is configured in `~/.kube/config` to connect the desired cluster. If you are using minikube, for example, you can run `kubectl config set-context minikube` to get `~/.kube/config` set up correctly.\\n\\n### Client\\n\\nThe client is a React application (using TypeScript) with minimal other dependencies.\\n\\nTo run the client, open a new terminal tab and navigate to the `/client` directory, run `npm i` and then `npm start`. This will open up a browser window to your local Skooner dashboard. If everything compiles correctly, it will load the site and then an error message will pop up `Unhandled Rejection (Error): Api request error: Forbidden...`. The error message has an \\'X\\' in the top righthand corner to close that message. After you close it, you should see the UI where you can enter your token.\\n\\n(Back to [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents))\\n\\n## Troubleshooting\\n\\n### Recommendation for keycloak configuration:\\n\\n1. Set OIDC_URL to keycloak OpenId endpoint configuration page.\\n- `OIDC_URL=https://{keycloak_domain}/realms/foo/.well-known/openid-configuration`\\n- Also set `$OIDC_ID` locally with `OIDC_ID={client_id}`\\n- You can get `$OIDC_SECRET` from keycloak \\n  - (You need to set the Client authentication toggle to be on, for older version of keycloaks you should switch access type to confidential )\\n     ![img.png](imgs/OIDC_keycloak_settings.png)\\n  - ![img.png](imgs/OIDC_SECTET_img.png)\\n\\n2. While creating secret, use correct var name and use skooner namespace (by default it\\'s `kube-system`):\\n\\n```\\nkubectl create secret generic skooner \\\\\\n--from-literal=url=$OIDC_URL \\\\\\n--from-literal=id=$OIDC_ID \\\\\\n--from-literal=secret=$OIDC_SECRET \\\\\\n--namespace=kube-system\\n```\\n\\n3. following that, redeploy skooner server with\\n   `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skooner-k8s/skooner/master/kubernetes-skooner-oidc.yaml`\\n\\n4. Make sure skooner is running by checking `kubectl rollout status deploy/skooner --namespace=kube-system`\\n   If not, report error with logging in `kubectl describe pod skooner --namespace=kube-system`\\n\\n5. [Optional] create an ingress for skooner, you can take `provision/keycloak/skooner-ingress.yaml` as an example\\n\\n6. visit skooner, check if login succeeded\\n\\n7. [Trouble Shooting] If the api call returns 403 with a message containing some error like: `User \\\\\"system:anonymous\\\\\" cannot list resource \\\\\"selfsubjectrulesreviews\\\\\" in API group \\\\\"authorization.k8s.io\\\\\" at the cluster scope\"` \\n   - it means you\\'ll need a cluster role bond.

Global query view of metrics.\\n2. Unlimited retention of metrics.\\n3. High availability of components, including Prometheus.\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n* **[Getting Started](https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/getting-started.md/)**\\n* [Design](https://thanos.io/tip/thanos/design.md/)\\n* [Blog posts](docs/getting-started.md#blog-posts)\\n* [Talks](docs/getting-started.md#talks)\\n* [Proposals](docs/proposals-done)\\n* [Integrations](docs/integrations.md)\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n* Global querying view across all connected Prometheus servers\\n* Deduplication and merging of metrics collected from Prometheus HA pairs\\n* Seamless integration with existing Prometheus setups\\n* Any object storage as its only, optional dependency\\n* Downsampling historical data for massive query speedup\\n* Cross-cluster federation\\n* Fault-tolerant query routing\\n* Simple gRPC \"Store API\" for unified data access across all metric data\\n* Easy integration points for custom metric providers\\n\\n## Architecture Overview\\n\\nDeployment with Sidecar for Kubernetes:\\n\\n<!---\\nSource file to copy and edit: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1AiMc1qAjASMbtqL6PNs0r9-ynGoZ9LIAtf0b9PjILxw/edit?usp=sharing\\n-->\\n\\n![Sidecar](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSJd32gPh8-MC5Ko0-P-v1KQ0Xnxa0qmsVXowtkwVGlczGfVW-Vd415Y6F129zvh3y0vHLBZcJeZEoz/pub?w=960&h=720)\\n\\nDeployment with Receive in order to scale out or implement with other remote write compatible sources:\\n\\n<!---\\nSource file to copy and edit: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iimTbcicKXqz0FYtSfz04JmmVFLVO9BjAjEzBm5538w/edit?usp=sharing\\n-->\\n\\n![Receive](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRdYP__uDuygGR5ym1dxBzU6LEx5v7Rs1cAUKPsl5BZrRGVl5YIj5lsD_FOljeIVOGWatdAI9pazbCP/pub?w=960&h=720)\\n\\n## Thanos Philosophy\\n\\nThe philosophy of Thanos and our community is borrowing much from UNIX philosophy and the golang programming language.\\n\\n* Each subcommand should do one thing and do it well\\n  * e.g. thanos query proxies incoming calls to known store API endpoints merging the result\\n* Write components that work together\\n  * e.g. blocks should be stored in native prometheus format\\n* Make it easy to read, write, and, run components\\n  * e.g. reduce complexity in system design and implementation\\n\\n## Releases\\n\\nMain branch should be stable and usable.

If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.\\n\\nNote: Trickster v1.1 is the production release, sourced from the [v1.1.x](https://github.com/trickstercache/trickster/tree/v1.1.x) branch. The `main` branch sources Trickster 2.0, which is currently in beta.\\n\\n## HTTP Reverse Proxy Cache\\n\\nTrickster is a fully-featured HTTP Reverse Proxy Cache for HTTP applications like static file servers and web API\\'s.\\n\\n### Proxy Feature Highlights\\n\\n* A unique and powerful [Application Load Balancer](./docs/alb.md) for Time Series and generic HTTP endpoints\\n* [Supports TLS](./docs/tls.md) and HTTP/2 for frontend termination and backend origination\\n* Offers several options for a [caching layer](./docs/caches.md), including in-memory, filesystem, Redis and bbolt\\n* [Highly customizable](./docs/configuring.md), using simple yaml configuration settings, [down to the HTTP Path](./docs/paths.md)\\n* Built-in Prometheus [metrics](./docs/metrics.md) and customizable [Health Check](./docs/health.md) Endpoints for end-to-end monitoring\\n* [Negative Caching](./docs/negative-caching.md) to prevent domino effect outages\\n* High-performance [Collapsed Forwarding](./docs/collapsed-forwarding.md)\\n* Best-in-class [Byte Range Request caching and acceleration](./docs/range_request.md).\\n* [Distributed Tracing](./docs/tracing.md) via OpenTelemetry, supporting Jaeger and Zipkin\\n* Rules engine for custom request routing and rewriting\\n\\n## Time Series Database Accelerator\\n\\nTrickster dramatically improves dashboard chart rendering times for end users by eliminating redundant computations on the TSDBs it fronts. In short, Trickster makes read-heavy Dashboard/TSDB environments, as well as those with highly-cardinalized datasets, significantly more performant and scalable.\\n\\n### Compatibility\\n\\nTrickster works with virtually any Dashboard application that makes queries to any of these TSDB\\'s:\\n\\n<img src=\"./docs/images/external/prom_logo_60.png\" width=16 /> Prometheus\\n\\n<img src=\"./docs/images/external/clickhouse_logo.png\" width=16 /> ClickHouse\\n\\n<img src=\"./docs/images/external/influx_logo_60.png\" width=16 /> InfluxDB\\n\\n<img src=\"./docs/images/external/irondb_logo_60.png\" width=16 /> Circonus IRONdb\\n\\nSee the [Supported TSDB Providers](./docs/supported-origin-types.md) document for full details\\n\\n### How Trickster Accelerates Time Series\\n\\n#### 1. Time Series Delta Proxy Cache\\n\\nMost dashboards request from a time series database the entire time range of data they wish to present, every time a user\\'s dashboard loads, as well as on every auto-refresh. Trickster\\'s Delta Proxy inspects the time range of a client query to determine what data points are already cached, and requests from the tsdb only the data points still needed to service the client request. This results in dramatically faster chart load times for everyone, since the tsdb is queried only for tiny incremental changes on each dashboard load, rather than several hundred data points of duplicative data.\\n\\n<img src=\"./docs/images/partial-cache-hit.png\" width=1024 />\\n\\n#### 2. Step Boundary Normalization\\n\\nWhen Trickster requests data from a tsdb, it adjusts the clients\\'s requested time range slightly to ensure that all data points returned are aligned to normalized step boundaries. For example, if the step is 300s, all data points will fall on the clock 0\\'s and 5\\'s. This ensures that the data is highly cacheable, is conveyed visually to users in a more familiar way, and that all dashboard users see identical data on their screens.\\n\\n<img src=\"./docs/images/step-boundary-normalization.png\" width=640 />\\n\\n#### 3. Fast Forward\\n\\nTrickster\\'s Fast Forward feature ensures that even with step boundary normalization, real-time graphs still always show the most recent data, regardless of how far away the next step boundary is. For example, if your chart step is 300s, and the time is currently 1:21p, you would normally be waiting another four minutes for a new data point at 1:25p. Trickster will break the step interval for the most recent data point and always include it in the response to clients requesting real-time data.\\n\\n<img src=\"./docs/images/fast-forward.png\" width=640 />\\n\\n## Trying Out Trickster\\n\\nCheck out our end-to-end [Docker Compose demo composition](./examples/docker-compose) for a zero-configuration running environment.\\n\\n## Installing\\n\\n### Docker\\n\\nDocker images are available on Docker Hub:\\n\\n    $ docker run --name trickster -d -v /path/to/trickster.yaml:/etc/trickster/trickster.yaml -p 0.0.0.0:8480:8480 trickstercache/trickster\\n\\nSee the \\'deploy\\' Directory for more information about using or creating Trickster docker images.\\n\\n### Kubernetes\\n\\nSee the \\'deploy\\' Directory for Kube and deployment files and examples.\\n\\n### Helm\\n\\nTrickster Helm Charts are located at <https://helm.tricksterproxy.io> for installation, and maintained at <https://github.com/trickstercache/helm-charts>. We welcome chart contributions.\\n\\n### Building from source\\n\\nTo build Trickster from the source code yourself you need to have a working\\nGo environment with [version 1.19 or greater installed](http://golang.org/doc/install).\\n\\nYou can directly use the `go` tool to download and install the `trickster`\\nbinary into your `GOPATH`:\\n\\n```bash\\n    $ go get github.com/trickstercache/trickster/cmd/trickster\\n    # this starts a prometheus accelerator proxy for the provided endpoint\\n    $ trickster -origin-url http://prometheus.example.com:9090 -provider prometheus\\n```\\n\\nYou can also clone the repository yourself and build using `make`:\\n\\n```bash\\n    $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/trickstercache\\n    $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/trickstercache\\n    $ git clone https://github.com/trickstercache/trickster.git\\n    $ cd trickster\\n    $ make build\\n    $ ./bin/trickster -origin-url http://prometheus.example.com:9090 -provider prometheus\\n```\\n\\nThe Makefile provides several targets, including:\\n\\n* *build*: build the `trickster` binary\\n* *docker*: build a docker container for the current `HEAD`\\n* *clean*: delete previously-built binaries and object files\\n* *test*: runs unit tests\\n* *bench*: runs benchmark tests\\n* *rpm*: builds a Trickster RPM\\n\\n## More information\\n\\n* Refer to the [docs](./docs/) directory for additional info.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nRefer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\\n\\n© 2021 The Linux Foundation.

If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who\\'s involved and how Jaeger plays a role, read the CNCF [Jaeger incubation announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/09/13/cncf-hosts-jaeger/) and [Jaeger graduation announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2019/10/31/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-jaeger-graduation/).\\n\\n## Get Involved\\n\\nJaeger is an open source project with open governance. We welcome contributions from the community, and we would love your help to improve and extend the project. Here are [some ideas](https://www.jaegertracing.io/get-involved/) for how to get involved. Many of them do not even require any coding.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n### High Scalability\\n\\nJaeger backend is designed to have no single points of failure and to scale with the business needs.\\nFor example, any given Jaeger installation at Uber is typically processing several billions of spans per day.\\n\\n### Native support for OpenTracing\\n\\nJaeger backend, Web UI, and instrumentation libraries have been designed from the ground up to support the [OpenTracing standard](https://opentracing.io/specification/).\\n  * Represent traces as directed acyclic graphs (not just trees) via [span references](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md#references-between-spans)\\n  * Support strongly typed span _tags_ and _structured logs_\\n  * Support general distributed context propagation mechanism via _baggage_\\n\\n#### OpenTelemetry\\n\\nJaeger project recommends OpenTelemetry SDKs for instrumentation, instead of Jaeger\\'s native SDKs [that are now deprecated](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/client-libraries/#deprecating-jaeger-clients).\\n\\nThe OpenTracing and OpenCensus projects have merged into a new CNCF project called [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io). The Jaeger and OpenTelemetry projects have different goals. OpenTelemetry aims to provide APIs and SDKs in multiple languages to allow applications to export various telemetry data out of the process, to any number of metrics and tracing backends. The Jaeger project is primarily the tracing backend that receives tracing telemetry data and provides processing, aggregation, data mining, and visualizations of that data. The Jaeger client libraries do overlap with OpenTelemetry in functionality. OpenTelemetry natively supports Jaeger as a tracing backend and makes Jaeger native clients unnecessary. For more information please refer to a blog post [Jaeger and OpenTelemetry](https://medium.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-and-opentelemetry-1846f701d9f2).\\n\\n### Multiple storage backends\\n\\nJaeger can be used with a growing a number of storage backends:\\n* It natively supports two popular open source NoSQL databases as trace storage backends: Cassandra and Elasticsearch.\\n* It integrates via a gRPC API with other well known databases that have been certified to be Jaeger compliant: [TimescaleDB via Promscale](https://github.com/timescale/promscale), [ClickHouse](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-clickhouse).\\n* There is embedded database support using [Badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) and simple in-memory storage for testing setups.\\n* ScyllaDB [can be used](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/blob/main/plugin/storage/scylladb/README.md) as a drop-in replacement for Cassandra since it uses the same data model and query language.\\n* There are ongoing community experiments using other databases, such as InfluxDB, Amazon DynamoDB, YugabyteDB(YCQL).\\n\\n### Modern Web UI\\n\\nJaeger Web UI is implemented in Javascript using popular open source frameworks like React. Several performance\\nimprovements have been released in v1.0 to allow the UI to efficiently deal with large volumes of data and to display\\ntraces with tens of thousands of spans (e.g. we tried a trace with 80,000 spans).\\n\\n### Cloud Native Deployment\\n\\nJaeger backend is distributed as a collection of Docker images. The binaries support various configuration methods,\\nincluding command line options, environment variables, and configuration files in multiple formats (yaml, toml, etc.).\\n\\nThe recommended way to deploy Jaeger in a production Kubernetes cluster is via the [Jaeger Operator](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator).\\n\\nThe Jaeger Operator provides a [CLI to generate](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator#experimental-generate-kubernetes-manifest-file) Kubernetes manifests from the Jaeger CR.\\nThis can be considered as an alternative source over plain Kubernetes manifest files.\\n\\nThe Jaeger ecosystem also provides a [Helm chart](https://github.com/jaegertracing/helm-charts) as an alternative way to deploy Jaeger.\\n\\n### Observability\\n\\nAll Jaeger backend components expose [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics by default (other metrics backends are\\nalso supported). Logs are written to standard out using the structured logging library [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap).\\n\\n### Security\\n\\nThird-party security audits of Jaeger are available in https://github.com/jaegertracing/security-audits. Please see [Issue #1718](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1718) for the summary of available security mechanisms in Jaeger.\\n\\n### Backwards compatibility with Zipkin\\n\\nAlthough we recommend instrumenting applications with OpenTelemetry, if your organization has already invested in the instrumentation\\nusing Zipkin libraries, you do not have to rewrite all that code. Jaeger provides backwards compatibility with Zipkin\\nby accepting spans in Zipkin formats (Thrift or JSON v1/v2) over HTTP. Switching from Zipkin backend is just a matter\\nof routing the traffic from Zipkin libraries to the Jaeger backend.\\n\\n## Version Compatibility Guarantees\\n\\nOccasionally, CLI flags can be deprecated due to, for example, usability improvements or new functionality.\\nIn such situations, developers introducing the deprecation are required to follow [these guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md#deprecating-cli-flags).\\n\\nIn short, for a deprecated CLI flag, you should expect to see the following message in the `--help` documentation:\\n```\\n(deprecated, will be removed after yyyy-mm-dd or in release vX.Y.Z, whichever is later)\\n```\\n\\nA grace period of at least **3 months** or **two minor version bumps** (whichever is later) from the first release\\ncontaining the deprecation notice will be provided before the deprecated CLI flag _can_ be deleted.\\n\\nFor example, consider a scenario where v1.28.0 is released on 01-Jun-2021 containing a deprecation notice for a CLI flag.\\nThis flag will remain in a deprecated state until the later of 01-Sep-2021 or v1.30.0 where it _can_ be removed on or after either of those events.\\nIt may remain deprecated for longer than the aforementioned grace period.\\n\\n## Go Version Compatibility Guarantees\\n\\nThe Jaeger project attempts to track the currently supported versions of Go, as [defined by the Go team](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy).\\nRemoving support for an unsupported Go version is not considered a breaking change.\\n\\nStarting with the release of Go 1.21, support for Go versions will be updated as follows:\\n\\n1. Soon after the release of a new Go minor version `N`, updates will be made to the build and tests steps to accommodate the latest Go minor version.\\n2. Soon after the release of a new Go minor version `N`, support for Go version `N-2` will be removed and version `N-1` will become the minimum required version.\\n\\n## Related Repositories\\n\\n### Documentation\\n\\n  * Published: https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/\\n  * Source: https://github.com/jaegertracing/documentation\\n\\n### Instrumentation Libraries\\n\\nJaeger project recommends OpenTelemetry SDKs for instrumentation, instead of Jaeger\\'s native SDKs [that are now deprecated](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/client-libraries/#deprecating-jaeger-clients).\\n\\n### Deployment\\n\\n  * [Jaeger Operator for Kubernetes](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-operator#getting-started)\\n\\n### Components\\n\\n * [UI](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-ui)\\n * [Data model](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-idl)\\n\\n## Building From Source\\n\\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nSee [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\\n\\nThanks to all the people who already contributed!\\n\\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/graphs/contributors\">\\n  <img src=\"https://contributors-img.web.app/image?repo=jaegertracing/jaeger\" />\\n</a>\\n\\n### Maintainers\\n\\nRules for becoming a maintainer are defined in the [GOVERNANCE](./GOVERNANCE.md) document.\\nBelow are the official maintainers of the Jaeger project.\\nPlease use `@jaegertracing/jaeger-maintainers` to tag them on issues / PRs.\\n\\n* [@albertteoh](https://github.com/albertteoh)\\n* [@jkowall](https://github.com/jkowall)\\n* [@joe-elliott](https://github.com/joe-elliott)\\n* [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay)\\n* [@yurishkuro](https://github.com/yurishkuro)\\n\\nSome repositories under [jaegertracing](https://github.com/jaegertracing) org have additional maintainers.\\n\\n### Emeritus Maintainers\\n\\nWe are grateful to our former maintainers for their contributions to the Jaeger project.\\n\\n* [@black-adder](https://github.com/black-adder)\\n* [@jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling)\\n* [@objectiser](https://github.com/objectiser)\\n* [@tiffon](https://github.com/tiffon)\\n* [@vprithvi](https://github.com/vprithvi)\\n\\n## Project Status Meetings\\n\\nThe Jaeger maintainers and contributors meet regularly on a video call.

It offers various types of fault simulation and has an enormous capability to orchestrate fault scenarios.\\n\\nUsing Chaos Mesh, you can conveniently simulate various abnormalities that might occur in reality during the development, testing, and production environments and find potential problems in the system. To lower the threshold for a Chaos Engineering project, Chaos Mesh provides you with a visualization operation. You can easily design your Chaos scenarios on the Web UI and monitor the status of Chaos experiments.\\n\\n![cncf_logo](./static/cncf.png#gh-light-mode-only)\\n![cncf_logo](./static/cncf-white.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\\n\\nChaos Mesh is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) incubating project. If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who\\'s involved and how Chaos Mesh plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/09/02/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-tikv-graduation/).\\n\\n---\\n\\nAt the current stage, Chaos Mesh has the following components:\\n\\n- **Chaos Operator**: the core component for chaos orchestration. Fully open sourced.\\n- **Chaos Dashboard**: a Web UI for managing, designing, monitoring Chaos Experiments.\\n\\nSee the following demo video for a quick view of Chaos Mesh:\\n\\n[![Watch the video](./static/demo.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifZEwdJO868)\\n\\n## Chaos Operator\\n\\nChaos Operator injects chaos into the applications and Kubernetes infrastructure in a manageable way, which provides easy, custom definitions for chaos experiments and automatic orchestration. There are three components at play:\\n\\n**Controller-manager**: used to schedule and manage the lifecycle of CRD objects.\\n\\n**Chaos-daemon**: runs as daemonset with privileged system permissions over network, Cgroup, etc. for a specific node.\\n\\n![Chaos Operator](./static/chaos-mesh.png)\\n\\nChaos Operator uses [CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/) to define chaos objects.\\nThe current implementation supports a few types of CRD objects for fault injection, namely DNSChaos, PodChaos, PodIOChaos, PodNetworkChaos, NetworkChaos, IOChaos, TimeChaos, StressChaos, and KernelChaos, which correspond to the following major actions (experiments):\\n\\n- pod-kill: The selected pod is killed (ReplicaSet or something similar may be needed to ensure the pod will be restarted).\\n- pod-failure: The selected pod will be unavailable in a specified period of time.\\n- container-kill: The selected container is killed in the selected pod.\\n- netem chaos: Network chaos such as delay, duplication, etc.\\n- network-partition: Simulate network partition.\\n- IO chaos: Simulate file system faults such as I/O delay, read/write errors, etc.\\n- time chaos: The selected pod will be injected with clock skew.\\n- cpu-burn: Simulate the CPU of the selected pod stress.\\n- memory-burn: Simulate the memory of the selected pod stress.\\n- kernel chaos: The selected pod will be injected with (slab, bio, etc) errors.\\n- dns chaos: The selected pod will be injected with dns errors, such as error, random.\\n\\n## Quick start\\n\\nSee [Chaos Mesh Docs](https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/).\\n\\n## Adopters\\n\\nSee [ADOPTERS](ADOPTERS.md).\\n\\n## Blogs\\n\\nBlogs on Chaos Mesh design & implementation, features, chaos engineering, community updates, etc. See [Chaos Mesh Blogs](https://chaos-mesh.org/blog).

It is based on Alibaba\\'s nearly ten years of failure testing and drill practice, and combines the best ideas and practices of the Group\\'s businesses.\\n\\nChaosBlade is not only easy to use, but also supports rich experimental scenarios. The scenarios include:\\n* Basic resources: such as CPU, memory, network, disk, process and other experimental scenarios;\\n* Java applications: such as databases, caches, messages, JVM itself, microservices, etc. You can also specify any class method to inject various complex experimental scenarios;\\n* C ++ applications: such as specifying arbitrary methods or experimental lines of code injection delay, tampering with variables and return values;\\n* container: such as killing the container, the CPU in the container, memory, network, disk, process and other experimental scenarios;\\n* Cloud-native platforms: For example, CPU, memory, network, disk, and process experimental scenarios on Kubernetes platform nodes, Pod network and Pod itself experimental scenarios such as killing Pods, and container experimental scenarios such as the aforementioned Docker container experimental scenario;\\n\\nEncapsulating scenes by domain into individual projects can not only standardize the scenes in the domain, but also facilitate the horizontal and vertical expansion of the scenes. By following the chaos experimental model, the chaosblade cli can be called uniformly. The items currently included are:\\n* [chaosblade](https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade): Chaos experiment management tool, including commands for creating experiments, destroying experiments, querying experiments, preparing experimental environments, and canceling experimental environments. It is the execution of chaotic experiments. Tools, execution methods include CLI and HTTP. Provides complete commands, experimental scenarios, and scenario parameter descriptions, and the operation is simple and clear.\\n* [chaosblade-spec-go](https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade-spec-go): Chaos experimental model Golang language definition, scenes implemented using Golang language are easy to implement based on this specification.\\n* [chaosblade-exec-os](https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade-exec-os): Implementation of basic resource experimental scenarios.\\n* [chaosblade-exec-docker](https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade-exec-docker): Docker container experimental scenario implementation, standardized by calling the Docker API.\\n* [chaosblade-exec-cri](https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade-exec-cri): Container experimental scenario implementation, standardized by calling the CRI.\\n* [chaosblade-operator](https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade-operator): Kubernetes platform experimental scenario is implemented, chaos experiments are defined by Kubernetes standard CRD method, it is very convenient to use Kubernetes resource operation method To create, update, and delete experimental scenarios, including using kubectl, client-go, etc., and also using the chaosblade cli tool described above.\\n* [chaosblade-exec-jvm](https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade-exec-jvm): Java application experimental scenario implementation, using Java Agent technology to mount dynamically, without any access, zero-cost use It also supports uninstallation and completely recycles various resources created by the Agent.\\n* [chaosblade-exec-cplus](https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade-exec-cplus): C ++ application experimental scenario implementation, using GDB technology to implement method and code line level experimental scenario injection.\\n\\n## CLI Command\\nYou can download the latest chaosblade toolkit from [Releases](https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade/releases) and extract it and use it. If you want to inject Kubernetes related fault scenarios, you need to install [chaosblade-operator](https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade-operator/releases). For detailed Chinese usage documents, please see [chaosblade-help-zh-cn ](https://chaosblade-io.gitbook.io/chaosblade-help-zh-cn/).\\n\\nchaosblade supports CLI and HTTP invocation methods. The supported commands are as follows:\\n* **prepare**: alias is p, preparation before the chaos engineering experiment, such as drilling Java applications, you need to attach the java agent. For example, to drill an application whose application name is business, execute `blade p jvm --process business` on the target host. If the attach is successful, return the uid for status query or agent revoke.\\n* **revoke**: alias is r, undo chaos engineering experiment preparation before, such as detaching java agent. The command is `blade revoke UID`\\n* **create**: alias is c, create a chaos engineering experiment. The command is `blade create [TARGET] [ACTION] [FLAGS]`. For example, if you implement a Dubbo consumer call xxx.xxx.Service interface delay 3s, the command executed is `blade create dubbo delay --consumer --time 3000 --Service xxx.xxx.Service`, if the injection is successful, return the experimental uid for status query and destroy the experiment.\\n* **destroy**: alias is d, destroy a chaos engineering experiment, such as destroying the Dubbo delay experiment mentioned above, the command is `blade destroy UID`\\n* **status**: alias s, query preparation stage or experiment status, the command is `blade status UID` or `blade status --type create`\\n* **server**: start the web server, expose the HTTP service, and call chaosblade through HTTP requests. For example, execute on the target machine xxxx: `blade server start -p 9526` to perform a CPU full load experiment:` curl \"http://xxxx:9526/chaosblade?cmd=create%20cpu%20fullload\" `\\n\\nUse the `blade help [COMMAND]` or `blade [COMMAND] -h` command to view help\\n\\n## Experience Demo\\nDownload the chaosblade demo image and experience the use of the blade toolkit\\n\\n![demo.gif](https://chaosblade.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/agent/release/chaosblade-demo-0.0.1.gif)\\n\\nDownload image command：\\n```shell script\\ndocker pull chaosbladeio/chaosblade-demo\\n```\\nRun the demo container：\\n```shell script\\ndocker run -it --privileged chaosbladeio/chaosblade-demo\\n```\\nAfter entering the container, you can read the README.txt file to implement the chaos experiment, Enjoy it.\\n\\n## Cloud Native\\n[chaosblade-operator](https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade-operator) The project is a chaos experiment injection tool for cloud-native platforms. It follows the chaos experiment model to standardize the experimental scenario and defines the experiment as Kubernetes CRD Resources, mapping experimental models to Kubernetes resource attributes, and very friendly combination of chaotic experimental models with Kubernetes declarative design. While relying on chaotic experimental models to conveniently develop scenarios, it can also well integrate Kubernetes design concepts, through kubectl or Write code to directly call the Kubernetes API to create, update, and delete chaotic experiments, and the resource status can clearly indicate the execution status of the experiment, and standardize Kubernetes fault injection. In addition to using the above methods to perform experiments, you can also use the chaosblade cli method to execute kubernetes experimental scenarios and query the experimental status very conveniently. For details, please read the chinese document: [Chaos Engineering Practice under Cloud Native](CLOUDNATIVE.md)\\n\\n## Compile\\nThis project is written in golang, so you need to install the latest golang version first.

Developers & SREs can practice Chaos Engineering with LitmusChaos as it is easy to use, based on modern \\nChaos Engineering principles & community collaborated. It is 100% open source & a CNCF project.\\n\\nLitmusChaos takes a cloud-native approach to create, manage and monitor chaos. The platform itself runs as a set of microservices and uses Kubernetes \\ncustom resources to define the chaos intent, as well as the steady state hypothesis. \\n\\nAt a high-level, Litmus comprises of:  \\n\\n- **Chaos Control Plane**: A centralized chaos management tool called chaos-center, which helps construct, schedule and visualize Litmus chaos workflows  \\n- **Chaos Execution Plane Services**: Made up of a chaos agent and multiple operators that execute & monitor the experiment within a defined \\n  target Kubernetes environment. \\n\\n![architecture summary](/images/litmus-control-and-execution-plane-overview.png)\\n\\nAt the heart of the platform are the following chaos custom resources: \\n\\n- **ChaosExperiment**: A resource to group the configuration parameters of a particular fault. ChaosExperiment CRs are essentially installable templates \\n  that describe the library carrying out the fault, indicate permissions needed to run it & the defaults it will operate with. Through the ChaosExperiment,  Litmus supports BYOC (bring-your-own-chaos) that helps integrate (optional) any third-party tooling to perform the fault injection. \\n\\n- **ChaosEngine**: A resource to link a Kubernetes application workload/service, node or an infra component to a fault described by the ChaosExperiment. \\n  It also provides options to tune the run properties and specify the steady state validation constraints using \\'probes\\'. ChaosEngine is watched by the \\n  Chaos-Operator, which reconciles it (triggers experiment execution) via runners. \\n\\nThe ChaosExperiment & ChaosEngine CRs are embedded within a Workflow object that can string together one or more experiments in a desired order.\\n\\n- **ChaosResult**: A resource to hold the results of the experiment run. It provides details of the success of each validation constraint, \\n  the revert/rollback status of the fault as well as a verdict. The Chaos-exporter reads the results and exposes information as prometheus metrics. \\n  ChaosResults are especially useful during automated runs. \\n\\nChaosExperiment CRs are hosted on <a href=\"https://hub.litmuschaos.io\" target=\"_blank\">hub.litmuschaos.io</a>. It is a central hub where the \\napplication developers or vendors share their chaos experiments so that their users can use them to increase the resilience of the applications \\nin production.\\n\\n![chaos-operator-flow](/images/chaos-operator-flow.png)\\n\\n## Use cases\\n\\n- **For Developers**: To run chaos experiments during application development as an extension of unit testing or integration testing.\\n- **For CI/CD pipeline builders**: To run chaos as a pipeline stage to find bugs when the application is subjected to fail paths in a pipeline.\\n- **For SREs**: To plan and schedule chaos experiments into the application and/or surrounding infrastructure. This practice identifies the weaknesses \\n  in the deployment system and increases resilience.\\n\\n## Getting Started with Litmus\\n\\nTo get started, check out the <a href=\"https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/introduction/what-is-litmus\" target=\"_blank\">Litmus Docs</a> and specifically the <a href=\"https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getting-started/installation#prerequisites\" target=\"_blank\">Installation section</a> of the <a href=\"https://docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getting-started/installation\" target=\"_blank\">Getting Started with Litmus</a> page.\\n\\n## Contributing to Chaos Hub\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://github.com/litmuschaos/community-charts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\" target=\"_blank\">Contributing Guidelines for the Chaos Hub</a>\\n\\n\\n## Community\\n\\n### Community Resources:\\n\\nFeel free to reach out if you have any queries,concerns, or feature requests\\n\\n- Give us a star ⭐️ - If you are using LitmusChaos or think it is an interesting project, we would love a star ❤️\\n\\n- Follow LitmusChaos on Twitter [@LitmusChaos](https://twitter.com/LitmusChaos).\\n\\n- Subscribe to the [LitmusChaos YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa57PMqmz_j0wnteRa9nCaw) for regular updates & meeting recordings. \\n\\n- To join our [Slack Community](https://slack.litmuschaos.io/) and meet our community members, put forward your questions & opinions, join the #litmus channel on the [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/). \\n### Community Meetings\\nThe Litmus community meets on the third wednesday of every month at 10:00PM IST/6:30 PM CEST/9:30 AM PST.\\n\\n- [Sync Up Meeting Link](https://harness-io.zoom.us/j/95100368978?pwd=b2VrdCtaakE5U3dhOElFMUJOaXVOUT09)\\n- [Sync Up Agenda & Meeting Notes](https://hackmd.io/a4Zu_sH4TZGeih-xCimi3Q)\\n- [Release Tracker](https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus/milestones)\\n\\n### Videos\\n\\n- [Cloud Native Live: Litmus Chaos Engine and a microservices demo app](https://youtu.be/hOghvd9qCzI)\\n- [Chaos Engineering hands-on - An SRE ideating Chaos Experiments and using LitmusChaos | July 2022](https://youtu.be/_x_7SiesjF0) \\n- [Achieve Digital Product Resiliency with Chaos Engineering](https://youtu.be/PQrmBHgk0ps)\\n- [How to create Chaos Experiments with Litmus | Litmus Chaos tutorial](https://youtu.be/mwu5eLgUKq4) @ [Is it Observable](https://www.youtube.com/c/IsitObservable)\\n- [Cloud Native Chaos Engineering Preview With LitmusChaos](https://youtu.be/pMWqhS-F3tQ)\\n- [Get started with Chaos Engineering with Litmus](https://youtu.be/5CI8d-SKBfc) @ [Containers from the Couch](https://www.youtube.com/c/ContainersfromtheCouch)\\n- [Litmus 2 - Chaos Engineering Meets Argo Workflows](https://youtu.be/B8DfYnDh2F4) @ [DevOps Toolkit](https://youtube.com/c/devopstoolkit)\\n- [Hands-on with Litmus 2.0 | Rawkode Live](https://youtu.be/D0t3emVLLko) @ [Rawkode Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrber_mFvp_FEF7D9u8PDEA)\\n- [Introducing LitmusChaos 2.0 / Dok Talks #74](https://youtu.be/97BiCNtJbDw) @ [DoK.community](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUnXJbHQ89R2uSfKsqQwGvQ)\\n- [Introduction to Cloud Native Chaos Engineering](https://youtu.be/LK0oDLQE4S8) @ [Kunal Kushwaha](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBGOUQHNNtNGcGzVq5rIXjw)\\n- [#EveryoneCanContribute cafe: Litmus - Chaos Engineering for your Kubernetes](https://youtu.be/IiyrEiK4stQ) @ [GitLab Unfiltered](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtZ0sc1HHNtGGWZFDRTh5A)\\n- [Litmus - Chaos Engineering for Kubernetes (CNCFMinutes 9)](https://youtu.be/rDQ9XKbSJIc) @ [Saiyam Pathak](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi-1nnN0eC9nRleXdZA6ncg)\\n- [Chaos Engineering with Litmus Chaos by Prithvi Raj || HACKODISHA Workshop](https://youtu.be/eyAG0svCsQA) @ [Webwiz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9yM_PkV0QIIsPA3qPrp)\\n\\n[And More....](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa57PMqmz_j0wnteRa9nCaw)\\n\\n### Blogs\\n\\n- CNCF: [Introduction to LitmusChaos](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/08/28/introduction-to-litmuschaos/)\\n- Hackernoon: [Manage and Monitor Chaos via Litmus Custom Resources](https://hackernoon.com/solid-tips-on-how-to-manage-and-monitor-chaos-via-litmus-custom-resources-5g1s33m9)\\n- [Observability Considerations in Chaos: The Metrics Story](https://dev.to/ksatchit/observability-considerations-in-chaos-the-metrics-story-6cb)\\n\\nCommunity Blogs:\\n\\n- Daniyal Rayn: [Do I need Chaos Engineering on my environment?

The runtime offers isolation and protection for operating system resources (e.g., file system, sockets, environment variables, processes) and memory space. The most important use case for WasmEdge is to safely execute user-defined or community-contributed code as plug-ins in a software product (e.g., SaaS, software-defined vehicles, edge nodes, or even blockchain nodes). It enables third-party developers, vendors, suppliers, and community members to extend and customize the software product. **[Learn more here](https://wasmedge.org/docs/contribute/users)**\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\n* [A Lightweight Design for High-performance Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07115), published on IEEE Software, Jan 2021.
